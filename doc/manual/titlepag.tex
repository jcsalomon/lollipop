(You know, this section and the next look much better if you sort the
\file{manual.oix} and \file{manual.cix} files before you format the
document the last time. Do put lines
 \Ver>\Writeopindex:no
\Writecsindex:no<Rev somewhere in
the top of the \file{manual.tex} file in order to prevent 
overwriting of these files
after you've sorted them.)
