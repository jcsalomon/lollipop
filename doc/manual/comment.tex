% comment.sty   version 3.0, 3 September 1992
% selectively in/exclude pieces of text: the user can define new
% comment versions, and each is controlled separately.
% Special comments can be defined where the user specifies the
% action that is to be taken with each comment line.
%
% This style can be used with plain TeX or LaTeX, and probably
% most other packages too.
%
% Author
%    Victor Eijkhout and Vafa Khalighi
%   persian-tex@tug.org
%
% Usage: all text included in between 
%    \comment ... \endcomment
% or \begin{comment} ... \end{comment}
% is discarded. The closing command should appear on a line
% of its own. No starting spaces, nothing after it.
% This environment should work with arbitrary amounts
% of comment. 
%
% Other 'comment' environments are defined by
% and are selected/deselected with
% \includecomment{versiona}
% \excludecoment{versionb}
%
% These environments are used as
% \versiona ... \endversiona
% or \begin{versiona} ... \end{versiona}
% with the closing command again on a line of its own.
%
% Special comments are defined as
% \specialcomment{name}{before commands}{after commands}
% where the second and third arguments are executed before
% and after each comment. By defining a control sequence 
% \Thiscomment#1{...} in the before commands the user can
% specify what is to be done which each comment line.
%
% Basic approach: 
% to comment something out, scoop up  every line in verbatim mode
% as macro argument, then throw it away.
% For inclusions, both the opening and closing comands 
% are defined as noop
