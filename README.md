Lollipop
========

Lollipop is `TeX made easy`. Lollipop simplifies macro writing and reduce the time of implementing a new layout to less than one hour for an average document. Someone with basic training with Tex programming can accomplish the task.

Lollipop is an attempt to make structured text formatting available for environments where previously only WYSIWYG packages could be used because adapting the layout is so much more easy with them than with traditional TeX macro packages.
