Lollipop
========

Lollipop is `TeX made easy`. Lollipop is a macro package that functions as a toolbox for writing TeX macros. Its main aim is 
to make macro writing so easy that implementing a fully new layout in TeX would become a matter of less than an hour for an average document, and that it would be a task that could be accomplished by someone with only a very basic training in TeX programming.

Lollipop is an attempt to make structured text formatting available for environments where previously only WYSIWYG packages could be used because adapting the layout is so much more easy with them than with traditional TeX macro packages.
