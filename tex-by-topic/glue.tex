\subject[glue]  Dimensions and GlueIn \TeX\ vertical and horizontal white spacecan have a possibility to adjust itself through `stretching' or\term glue\par`shrinking'. An~adjustable white space is called `glue'.This chapter treats all technical concepts related todimensions and glue, and it explains how the badness of stretching or shrinkinga  certain amount is calculated.\invent\item dimen       Dimension register prefix.\item dimendef       Define a control sequence to be a synonym for      a~\cs{dimen} register.\item newdimen       Allocate an unused dimen register. \item skip       Skip register prefix.\item skipdef       Define a control sequence to be a synonym for      a~\cs{skip} register.\item newskip      Allocate an unused skip register.\item ifdim       Compare two dimensions. \item hskip        Insert in horizontal mode a glue item.\item hfil       Equivalent to       \csterm hfil\par      \ver-\hskip 0cm plus 1fil-.\item hfilneg       Equivalent to       \csterm hfilneg\par      \ver-\hskip 0cm minus 1fil-.\item hfill       Equivalent to       \csterm hfill\par      \ver-\hskip 0cm plus 1fill-.\item hss       Equivalent to       \csterm hss\par      \ver-\hskip 0cm plus 1fil minus 1fil-.\item vskip        Insert in vertical mode a glue item.\item vfil       Equivalent to       \csterm vfil\par      \ver-\vskip 0cm plus 1fil-.\item vfill       Equivalent to       \csterm vfill\par      \ver-\vskip 0cm plus 1fill-.\item vfilneg       Equivalent to       \csterm vfilneg\par      \ver-\vskip 0cm minus 1fil-.\item vss       Equivalent to       \csterm vss\par      \ver-\vskip 0cm plus 1fil minus 1fil-.\item kern        Add a kern item to the current horizontal or vertical list.\item lastkern       If the last item on the current list was a kern, the size of it.\item lastskip       If the last item on the current list was a~glue, the size of it.\item unkern       If the last item of the current list was a~kern, remove it.\item unskip       If the last item of the current list was a~glue, remove it.\item removelastskip      Macro to append the negative of the \cs{lastskip}.\item advance       Arithmetic command to add to or subtract from      a~\gr{numeric variable}.\item multiply       Arithmetic command to multiply a~\gr{numeric variable}.\item divide       Arithmetic command to divide a~\gr{numeric variable}.\inventstop\point Definition of \gr{glue} and \gr{dimen}This section givesthe syntax of the quantities\gr{dimen} and \gr{glue}. In the next section the practical aspects of glue are treated.Unfortunately the terminology for glue is slightly confusing.The syntactical quantity~\gr{glue} is a dimension (a distance) withpossibly a stretch and/""or shrink component.In order to add a glob of `glue' (a white space) to a list one has tolet a \gr{glue} be preceded by commands such as \cs{vskip}.\spoint Definition of dimensionsA~\gr{dimen} is what \TeX\ expects to see whenit needs to indicate a dimension; it can be positive or negative.\disp\gr{dimen} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{optional signs}%     \gr{unsigned dimen}\dispstopThe unsigned part of a \gr{dimen} can be\disp\gr{unsigned dimen} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{normal dimen}     $|$ \gr{coerced dimen}\nl     \gr{normal dimen} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{internal dimen}     $|$ \gr{factor}\gr{unit of measure}\nl     \gr{coerced dimen} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{internal glue}     \dispstopThat is, we have the following three cases:\itemlist \item an \gr{internal dimen};

The meaning of these dimensions is explained in Chapter \ref[page:break], with theexception of \cs{prevdepth} which is treated inChapter~\ref[baseline].\spoint Definition of glueA \gr{glue} is either some form of glue variable, ora glue denotation with explicitly indicated stretch andshrink. Specifically,\disp\gr{glue} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{optional signs}\gr{internal glue}     $|$ \gr{dimen}\gr{stretch}\gr{shrink}\nl     \gr{internal glue} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{glue parameter}     $|$ \cs{lastskip}\nl      \indent $|$ \gr{skipdef token} $|$ \cs{skip}\gr{8-bit number}\nl     \gr{glue parameter} $\longrightarrow$ \cs{abovedisplayshortskip}\nl     \indent $|$ \cs{abovedisplayskip} $|$ \cs{baselineskip}\nl     \indent $|$ \cs{belowdisplayshortskip} $|$ \cs{belowdisplayskip}\nl     \indent $|$ \cs{leftskip} $|$ \cs{lineskip} $|$ \cs{parfillskip}             $|$ \cs{parskip}\nl     \indent $|$ \cs{rightskip} $|$ \cs{spaceskip}             $|$ \cs{splittopskip} $|$ \cs{tabskip}\nl     \indent $|$ \cs{topskip} $|$ \cs{xspaceskip}     \>The stretch and shrink components in a glue denotationare optional, but when both are specified they have tobe given in sequence; they are defined as\disp\gr{stretch} $\longrightarrow$ \n{plus} \gr{dimen}      $|$ \n{plus}\gr{fil dimen} $|$ \gr{optional spaces}\nl\gr{shrink} $\longrightarrow$ \n{minus} \gr{dimen}      $|$ \n{minus}\gr{fil dimen} $|$ \gr{optional spaces}\nl\gr{fil dimen} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{optional signs}\gr{factor}%     \gr{fil unit}\gr{optional spaces}\nl\gr{fil unit} $\longrightarrow$ \n{ $|$ fil $|$ fill $|$ filll}\>The actual definition of \gr{fil unit} is recursive(see Chapter~\ref[gramm]), but these are the only validpossibilities.\spoint Conversion of \gr{glue} to \gr{dimen}The grammar rule\disp\gr{dimen} $\longrightarrow$     \gr{factor}\gr{unit of measure}\>has some noteworthy consequences, caused by the factthat a \gr{unit of measure} need not look like a `unit of measure'at all (see the list above).For instance, from this definition we conclude that the statement\Ver>\dimen0=\lastpenalty\lastpenalty<Rev issyntactically correct because \cs{lastpenalty} can functionboth as an integer and as \gr{unit of measure} by takingits value in scaled points.After \ver>\penalty8> the \cs{dimen0} thus defined willhave a size of~\n{64sp}.More importantly, consider the case where the \gr{unit of measure} isan \gr{internal glue}, that is, any sort of glue parameter.Prefixing such a glue with a number (the \gr{factor})makes it a valid \gr{dimen} specification.Thus \Ver>\skip0=\skip1<Rev is very differentfrom \Ver>\skip0=1\skip1<Rev The first statement makes\cs{skip0} equal to \cs{skip1}, the second convertsthe \cs{skip1} to a \gr{dimen} before assigning it.In other words, the \cs{skip0} defined by the second statementhas no stretch or shrink.\spoint Registers for \cs{dimen} and \cs{skip}\TeX\ has registers for storing \gr{dimen} and \gr{glue}\csterm dimen\par\csterm skip\parvalues: the \cs{dimen} and \cs{skip} registersrespectively. These are accessible by the expressions\disp\cs{dimen}\gr{number}\> and\disp\cs{skip}\gr{number}\>As with all registers of \TeX, these registers arenumbered~0--255.Synonyms for registers can be made with the \cs{dimendef} and\csterm dimendef\par\csterm skipdef\par\cs{skipdef} commands. Their syntax is\Disp\cs{dimendef}\gr{control sequence}\gr{equals}\gr{8-bit number}\Dispstopand \Disp\cs{skipdef}\gr{control sequence}\gr{equals}\gr{8-bit number}\DispstopFor example, after \ver-\skipdef\foo=13- using \cs{foo}is equivalent to using \cs{skip13}.Macros \cs{newdimen} and \cs{newskip} exist in plain \TeX\csterm newdimen\par\csterm newskip\parfor allocating an unused dimen or skip register.These macros are defined to be \cs{outer} in the plain format.\spoint Arithmetic: additionAs for integer variables, arithmetic operations exist for\csterm advance\par\term arithmetic on glue\pardimen, glue, and muglue (mathematical glue; see page~\pgref[muglue])variables.The expressions\Disp\cs{advance}\gr{dimen variable}\gr{optional \n{by}}%     \gr{dimen}\nl     \cs{advance}\gr{glue variable}\gr{optional \n{by}}%     \gr{glue}\nl     \cs{advance}\gr{muglue variable}\gr{optional \n{by}}%     \gr{muglue}\Dispstopadd to the size of a dimen, glue, or muglue.Advancing a \gr{glue variable} by \gr{glue} is done byadding the natural sizes, and the stretch and shrink components.Because \TeX\ converts between \gr{glue} and \gr{dimen},it is possible to write for instance\Ver>\advance\skip1 by \dimen1<Rev or\Ver>\advance\dimen1 by \skip1<RevIn the first case  \cs{dimen1} is coerced to \gr{glue} withoutstretch or shrink; in the second case the \cs{skip1} is coercedto a \gr{dimen} by taking its natural size.\spoint Arithmetic: multiplication and divisionMultiplication and division operations exist for glue\csterm multiply\par\csterm divide\parand dimensions. One may for instance write\Ver>\multiply\skip1 by 2<Revwhich multiplies the natural size, and the stretch and shrinkcomponents of \cs{skip1} by~2.The second operand of a \cs{multiply} or \cs{divide}operation can only be a \gr{number}, that is, an integer.Introducing the notion of \gr{numeric variable}:\disp\gr{numeric variable} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{integer variable}     $|$ \gr{dimen variable} \nl     \indent $|$ \gr{glue variable} $|$ \gr{muglue variable}\dispstopthese operations take the form\Disp\cs{multiply}\gr{numeric variable}\gr{optional \n{by}}%\gr{number}\Dispstop and\Disp\cs{divide}\gr{numeric variable}\gr{optional \n{by}}%\gr{number}\DispstopGlue and dimen can be multiplied by non-integer quantities:\Ver>\skip1=2.5\skip2\dimen1=.78\dimen2<RevHowever, in the first line the \cs{skip2} is first coercedto a \gr{dimen} value by omitting its stretch and shrink.\point More about dimensions\spoint Units of measurementIn \TeX\ dimensions can be indicated in\term units of measurement\par\description \item centimetre    denoted \n{cm} or \item millimetre	denoted \n{mm}; these are SI~units ({\italic Syst\`eme International	d'Unit\'es}, the	international system of standard units of measurements).\item inch\n{in}; more common in the Anglo-American world.One inch is 2.54~centimetres.\item pica    denoted \n{pc}; one pica is 12~points.\item point    denoted \n{pt}; the common systemfor Anglo-American printers. One inch is 72.27 points.\item didot point    denoted \n{dd}; the common system for continental European printers.    Furthermore, 1157 didot points are 1238~points.\item cicero    denoted \n{cc}; one cicero is 12~didot points.\item big point    denoted \n{bp}; one inch is 72 big points.\item scaled point    denoted \n{sp}; this is the smallest unit in \TeX, and all measurements    are integral multiples of one scaled point.    There are $65\,536$ scaled points in a~point.\descriptionstopDecimal fractions can be written using both theAnglo-American system with the decimal point(for example, \n{1in}=\n{72.27pt})and the continental European system with a decimalcomma; \n{1in}=\n{72,27pt}.Internally \TeX\ works with multiples of a smallest dimension: the  scaled point.Dimensions larger (in absolute value) than $2^{30}-1$\n{sp},which is about 5.75~metres or 18.9~feet, are illegal.Both the pica system and the didot system are of Frenchorigin: in 1737 the type founder Pierre Simon Fournierintroduced typographical points based on the French foot.Although at first he introduced a system based on lines andpoints, he later took the point as unit:there are 72 points in an inch,which is one-twelfth of a foot. About 1770 another founder, Fran\c{c}ois Ambroise Didot, introducedpoints based on the more common, and slightly longer,`pied du roi'.\spoint Dimension testingDimensions and natural sizes of glue can be compared withthe \cs{ifdim} test. This takes the form\disp\cs{ifdim}\gr{dimen$_1$}\gr{relation}\gr{dimen$_2$}\dispstopwhere the relation can be an \n>, \n<, or~\n= token, all of category~12.\spoint Defined dimensions\invent\item z@ \n{0pt}\item maxdimen       \n{16383.99999pt}; the largest legal dimension.\>These \gr{dimen}s are predefined in the plain format;for instance \Ver>\newdimen\z@ \z@=0pt<RevUsing such abbreviations for commonly used dimensionshas at least two advantages. First of all it saves main memoryif such a dimension occurs in a macro: a control sequenceis one token, whereas a string such as \n{0pt} takes three.Secondly, it saves time in processing, as \TeX\ does not needto perform conversions to arrive at the correct type ofobject.Control sequences such as \cs{z@}are only available to a user who changes thecategory code of the `at' sign. Ordinarily, these control sequencesappear only in the macros defined in packages such as theplain format.\point More about glueGlue items can be added to a vertical list with one of the\altcommands \cs{vskip}\gr{glue}, \cs{vfil}, \cs{vfill}, \cs{vss} or\csterm vskip\par\cs{vfilneg}; glue items can be added to a horizontal list with one of thecommands \cs{hskip}\gr{glue}, \cs{hfil}, \cs{hfill}, \cs{hss} or\csterm hskip\par\cs{hfilneg}. We will now treat the properties of glue.\spoint Stretch and shrinkIn the syntax given above, \gr{glue} was defined as having\term stretch\par\term shrink\par\itemlist\item a `natural size', which is a \gr{dimen}, and optionally\item a `stretch' and `shrink' component built out of a \gr{fil dimen}.\itemliststopEach list that \TeX\ builds has amounts of stretch and shrink(possibly zero),which are the sum of thestretch and shrink components of individual pieces of glue in the list. Stretch and shrink are used if the context in which the listappears requires it to assume a size that is different fromits natural size.There is an important difference in behaviour between stretchand shrink components when they are finite \ldash that is,when the \gr{fildimen} is not \n{fil}(\n{l}(\n{l})). A~finite amount of shrink is indeed the maximum shrinkthat \TeX\ will take: the amount of glue specifiedas \Ver>5pt minus 3pt<Rev can shrink to \n{2pt}, but not further.In contrast to this, a finite amount of stretch can be stretched arbitrarily far. Such arbitrary stretchinghas a large `badness', however.Badness calculation is treated below.\examplesThe sequence with natural size \n{20pt}\Ver>\hskip 10pt plus 2pt \hskip 10pt plus 3pt<Revhas \n{5pt} of stretch, but it has no shrink. In\Ver>\hskip 10pt minus 2pt \hskip 10pt plus 3pt<Revthere is \n{3pt} of stretch, and \n{2pt} of shrink,so its minimal size is~\n{18pt}. Positive shrink is not the same as negative stretch:\Ver>\hskip 10pt plus -2pt \hskip 10pt plus 3pt<Revlooks a lot like the previous example, but it cannotbe shrunk as there are no \hbox{\n{minus}\gr{dimen}}specifications. It does have \n{1pt} of stretch, however.This is another example of negative amounts of shrink and stretch.It is not possible to stretchglue (in the informal sense) by shrinking it (in the technicalsense): \Ver>\hbox to 5cm{a\hskip 0cm minus -1fil}<Revis an underfull box, because \TeX\ looks for a \n{plus}~\gr{dimen}specification when it needs to stretch the contents.Finally, \Ver>\hskip 10pt plus -3pt \hskip 10pt plus 3pt<Revcan neither stretch nor shrink.The fact that there is only stretchavailable means that the sequence cannotshrink. However, the stretch components cancel out: the total stretch is zero. Another way of looking at thisis to consider that for each point that the second glue item wouldstretch, the first one would `stretch back' one point.\>Any amount of infinite stretch or shrink overpowers allfinite stretch or shrink available:\Ver>\hbox to 5cm{\hskip 0cm plus 16384pt               text\hskip 0cm plus 0.0001fil}<Revhas the \n{text} at the extreme left of the box.There are three orders of `infinity', each  one infinitelystronger than the previous one:\Ver>\hbox to 5cm{\hskip 0cm plus 16384fil              text\hskip 0cm plus 0.0001fill}<Revand\Ver>\hbox to 5cm{\hskip 0cm plus 16384fill              text\hskip 0cm plus 0.0001filll}<Revboth have the \n{text} at the left end of the box.\spoint Glue settingIn the process of `glue setting', the desired width (or height)\term glue setting\parof a box is compared with the natural dimension of its contents,which is the sum of all natural dimensions of boxes and globs of glue.If the two differ, any available stretchability or shrinkability is usedto bridge the gap.To attain the desired dimension of the boxonly the glue of the highest available order is set:each piece of glue of that order is stretched or shrunk by thesame ratio.For example, in\Ver>\hbox to 6pt{\hskip 0pt plus 3pt \hskip 0pt plus 9pt}<Revthe natural size of the box is~\n{0pt}, andthe total stretch is~\n{12pt}. In order to obtain a boxof~\n{6pt} each glue item is set with a stretch ratioof~$1/2$. Thus the result is equivalent to\Ver>\hbox {\hskip 1.5pt \hskip 4.5pt}<RevOnly the highest order of stretch or shrink is used:in \Ver>\hbox to 6pt{\hskip 0pt plus 1fil \hskip 0pt plus 9pt}<Revthe second glue  will assume its natural size of~\n{0pt},and only the first   glue will be stretched.\TeX\ will never exceed the maximum value of a finiteamount of shrink.A~box that cannot be shrunk enough is called `overfull'.Finite stretchability can be exceeded to provide anescape in difficult situations; however, \TeX\ is likely to give an \ver-Underfull \hbox- message about this(see page~\pgref[over/underfull]).For an example of infinite shrink see page~\pgref[rlap].\spoint BadnessWhen stretching or shrinking a list \TeX\ calculates \term badness calculation\parbadness based on theratio between actual stretch and the amount of stretchpresent in the line. See Chapter~\ref[line:break]for the application  of badness to the paragraph algorithm.%\tracingmacros=2 \tracingcommands\tracingmacrosThe formula for badness of a list that is stretched (shrunk) is\label[bad:form]\message{Check roman min}\disp $\displaystyle b=\hbox{min}\left(10\,000,100\times \left({\hbox{actual amount stretched (shrunk)}\over\hbox{possible amount of stretch (shrink)}}\right)^3\right)$\>In reality \TeX\ uses a slightly different formula that iseasier to calculate, but behaves the same. Since glue setting isone of the main activities of \TeX, this must be performedas efficiently as possible.This formula lets the badness be a reasonably small numberif the glue set ratio (the fraction in the above expression)is reasonably small, but will let it grow rapidly oncethe ratio is more than~1. Badness is infinite if theglue would have to shrink more than the allotted amount;stretching glue beyond its maximum is possible, so thisprovides an  escape for very difficult lines of text or pages.In \TeX3, the \cs{badness} parameter records the badnessof the most recently formed box.\spoint Glue and breaking\TeX\ can break lines and pages in several kinds of places.One of these places is before a glue item. The glue is then discarded. For line breaks this is treatedin Chapter~\ref[line:break], for page breaks see Chapter~\ref[page:break].There are two macros in plain \TeX, \cs{hglue} and \cs{vglue},\csterm hglue\par\csterm vglue\parthat give non-disappearing glue in horizontal andvertical mode respectively. For the horizontal case this isaccomplished byplacing:\Ver>\vrule width 0pt \nobreak \hskip ...<RevBecause \TeX\ breaks at the front end of glue,this glue will always stay attached to the rule,and will therefore never disappear.The actual macro definitions are somewhat more complicated,because they take care to preserve the \cs{spacefactor} and the\cs{prevdepth}.\spoint \cs{kern}The \cs{kern} command specifies\csterm kern\para~kern item in whatever mode \TeX\ is currentlyin. A~kern item is much like a glue item withoutstretch or shrink.It differs from glue in that it isin general not a legal breakpoint. Thus in\Ver>.. text .. \hbox{a}\kern0pt\hbox{b}<Rev\TeX\ will not break lines in between the boxes; in\Ver>.. text .. \hbox{a}\hskip0pt\hbox{b}<Reva line can be broken in between the boxes.However, if a kern is followed by glue, \TeX\ can break at thekern (provided that it is not in math mode). In horizontal modeboth the kern and the glue then disappear in the break.In vertical mode they are discarded when they are moved tothe (empty) current page after the material beforethe break has been disposed of by the output routine (see Chapter~\ref[page:break]).\spoint Glue and modesAll horizontal skip commands are \gr{horizontal command}s andall vertical skip commands are \gr{vertical commands}s.This means that, for instance, an \cs{hskip} commandmakes \TeX\ start a paragraph if it is given in vertical mode.The \cs{kern} command can be given in both modes.\spoint The last  glue item in a list: backspacingThe last glue item in a list can be measured, andit can be removed in all modes but external vertical mode.The internal variables\cs{lastskip} and  \cs{lastkern} can be used\csterm lastskip\par\csterm lastkern\parto measure the last glob of glue in all modes;if the last glue was not a skip or kern respectivelythey give~\n{0pt}.In math mode the \cs{lastskip}functions as \gr{internal muglue}, but in generalit classifies as \gr{internal glue}.The \cs{lastskip} and \cs{lastkern}are also \n{0pt} if that was the size of the last glue orkern item on the list.The operations\label[unskip]\cs{unskip} and \cs{unkern} remove the last item of a list,\csterm unskip\par\csterm unkern\parif this is a glue or kern respectively. They have no effectin external vertical mode; in that case thebest substitute is \ver=\vskip-\lastskip= and~\ver=\kern-\lastkern=.In the process of paragraph building \TeX\ itself performsan important \cs{unskip}: a~paragraph ending with awhite line will have a space token inserted by \TeX's input processor.This is removed by an \cs{unskip} before the \cs{parfillskip} glue(see Chapter~\ref[par:end]) is inserted.Glue is treated by \TeX\ as a special case of leaders,which becomes apparent when \cs{unskip} is applied toleaders: they are removed.\spoint Examples of backspacingThe plain \TeX\ macro \cs{removelastskip} is defined\csterm removelastskip\paras \Ver>\ifdim\lastskip=0pt \else \vskip-\lastskip \fi<RevIf the last item on the list was a glue, this macro willbackspace by its value, provided its natural size was not zero.In all other cases, nothing is added to the list.Sometimes an intelligent version of commands such as \cs{vskip}is necessary, in the sense that two subsequent skip commandsshould result only in the larger of the two glue amounts.On page~\pgref[skip:scheme] such a macro is used:\Ver>\newskip\tempskipa\def\vspace#1{\tempskipa=#1\relax    \ifvmode \ifdim\tempskipa<\lastskip              \else \vskip-\lastskip \vskip\tempskipa             \fi    \else \vskip\tempskipa \fi}<RevFirst of all, this tests whether the mode is vertical; if not, the argument can safely be placed.Copying the argument into a skip register is necessarybecause \cs{v\-space}\ver>{2pt plus 3pt}> would lead to problems in an \ver>\ifdim#1<\lastskip> test.If the surrounding mode was vertical, the argumentshould only be placed if it is not less than what isalready there. The macro would be incorrectif the test  read\Ver>        \ifdim\tempskipa>\lastskip             \vskip-\lastskip \vskip\tempskipa        \fi<RevIn this case the sequence\Ver>... last word.\par \vspace{0pt plus 1fil}<Revwould not place any glue, because afterthe \cs{par} we are in vertical mode and\cs{lastskip} has a value of \n{0pt}.\spoint Glue in trace outputIf the workings of \TeX\ are traced by setting\cs{tracingoutput} positive, or if \TeX\ writes a box to the log file (because of a \cs{showbox} command, or because itis overfull or underfull),glue  is denoted by the control sequence \cs{glue}.This is not a \TeX\ command; it merely indicates the presenceof glue in the current list.The box representation that \TeX\ generated from,\altfor instance, \cs{showbox}inserts a space after every explicit \cs{kern},but no space is inserted after an implicitkern that was inserted by the kerning information in the font\n{tfm} file. Thus \hbox{\ver-\kern 2.0pt-} denotes a kernthat was inserted by the user or by a macro, and\ver-\kern2.0pt- denotes an implicit kern.Glue that is inserted automatically (\cs{topskip}, \cs{baselineskip},et cetera) is denoted by name in \TeX's trace output.For example, the box\Ver>\vbox{\hbox{Vo}\hbox{b}}<Revlooks like\Ver>\vbox(18.83331+0.0)x11.66669.\hbox(6.83331+0.0)x11.66669..\tenrm V..\kern-0.83334..\tenrm o.\glue(\baselineskip) 5.05556.\hbox(6.94444+0.0)x5.55557..\tenrm b<RevNote the implicit kern inserted between `V' and~`o'.\endinput
