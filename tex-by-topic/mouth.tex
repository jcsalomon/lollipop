The reading mechanism has three internalstates, and transitions between these states are effectedby category codes of characters in the input.This chapter describes how \TeX\ reads its input andhow the category codes of characters influence thereading behaviour. Spaces and line ends are discussed.\invent\item endlinechar        The character code of the end-of-line character       appended to input lines.      \IniTeX\ default:~13.\item par        Command to close off a paragraph and go into vertical mode.      Is generated by empty lines.\item ignorespaces         Command that reads and expands until something is      encountered that is not a \gr{space token}.\item catcode       Query or set category codes.\item ifcat        Test whether two characters have the same category code.\item \char32\ {}      Control space.      Insert the same amount of space that a space token would      when \cs{spacefactor}${}=1000$.\item obeylines      Macro in plain \TeX\ to make line ends significant.\item obeyspaces      Macro in plain \TeX\ to make (most) spaces significant.\inventstop\point Introduction\TeX's input processor scans input lines from a file or terminal, andmakes tokens out of the characters.The input processor can be viewed asa simple finite state automaton with three internal states; depending on the state its scanning behaviour may differ.This automaton will be treated here both from the point of view of theinternal states and of the category codes governing thetransitions.\point Initial processingInput from a file (or from the user terminal, but thiswill not be mentioned specificallymost of the time) is handled one line at a time.Here follows a discussion of what exactly is an input linefor \TeX.Computer systems differ with respect to \term input lines\par\term line end\par\term machine independence\parthe exact definition of an inputline. The carriage return/""line feed\awp\message{slash-dash}%sequence terminating a line is most common,but some systems use just a line feed, andsome systems with fixed record length (block) storage do not havea line terminator at all. Therefore \TeX\ has itsown way of terminating an input line.\enumerate\item An input line is read from an input file  (minus theline terminator, if any).\item Trailing spaces are removed (this is for the systemswith block storage, and it prevents confusion because thesespaces are hard to see in an editor).\item The \cstoidx endlinechar\par, by default \gram{return}(code~13) is appended.If the value of \cs{endlinechar} is negative\label[append:elc]%or more than~255 (this was 127 in versions of \TeX\ olderthan version~3; see page~\pgref[2vs3] for more differences),no character is appended. The effect then is the same asif the line were to end with a comment character.\>Computers may also differ in the character encoding(the most common schemes are \ascii{} and \ebcdic{}), so \TeX\converts the characters that are read from the file to itsown character codes. These codes are then used exclusively,so that \TeX\ will perform the same on any system.For more on this, see Chapter~\ref[char].\point Category codesEach of the 256 character codes (0--255) has an\term category codes\parassociated category code, though not necessarily always the same one.There are 16 categories, numbered 0--15. When scanning the input, \TeX\thus forms character-code--category-code pairs.The input processor sees only these pairs; from them are formedcharacter tokens, control sequence tokens, and parameter tokens.These tokens are then passed to \TeX's expansion and executionprocesses.A~character token is a character-code--category-codepair that is passed unchanged.A~control sequence token consists of one or more characterspreceded by an escape character; see below.Parameter tokens are also explained below.This is the list of the categories, together with a briefdescription. More elaborate explanations follow in this andlater chapters.\enumerate \SetCounter:item=-1\item[ini:esc] Escape character; this signals the start of a control      sequence. \IniTeX\ makes the backslash \ver-\- (code~92)      an escape character.\item Beginning of group; such a character causes \TeX\ to enter a new      level of grouping. The plain format makes the open brace \ver-{-      a beginning"-of-group character.\item End of group; \TeX\ closes the current level of grouping.      Plain \TeX\ has  the closing brace \ver-}- as end-of-group      character.\item Math shift; this is the opening and closing delimiter for      math formulas. Plain \TeX\ uses the dollar sign~\ver-$-      for this.\item Alignment tab; the column (row) separator in tables      made with \cs{halign} (\cs{valign}). In plain      \TeX\ this is the ampersand~\ver-&-.\item[ini:eol] End of line; a character that \TeX\ considers      to signal the      end of an input line.      \IniTeX\ assigns this code to the \gram{return}, that is, code~13.      Not coincidentally, 13~is also the value that \IniTeX\      assigns to the \cs{endlinechar} parameter; see above.\awp\item Parameter character; this indicates parameters for macros.      In plain \TeX\ this is the hash sign~\ver-#-.\item Superscript; this precedes superscript expressions       in math mode. It is also used to denote character      codes that cannot      be entered in an input file; see below.       In plain \TeX\ this is the circumflex~\ver-^-.\item Subscript; this precedes subscript expressions in math mode.      In plain \TeX\ the underscore~\ver-_- is used for this.\item Ignored; characters of this category are removed      from the input, and have therefore no influence on      further \TeX\ processing. In plain \TeX\ this is      the \gr{null} character, that is, code~0.\item[ini:sp] Space; space characters receive special treatment.      \IniTeX\ assigns this category to the \ascii{} \gr{space}      character, code~32.\item[ini:let] Letter; in \IniTeX\ only the characters \n{a..z}, \n{A..Z}      are in this category. Often, macro packages make      some `secret' character (for instance~\n@) into a letter.\item[ini:other] Other; \IniTeX\ puts everything that is       not in the other categories into this category. Thus      it includes, for instance, digits and punctuation.\item Active; active characters function as a \TeX\ command,      without being preceded by an escape character.      In plain \TeX\ this is only the tie character~\ver-~-,      which is defined to produce      an unbreakable space; see page~\pgref[tie].\item[ini:comm] Comment character; from a comment character onwards,      \TeX\ considers the rest of an input line to be      comment and ignores it. In \IniTeX\ the  per cent sign \ver-%-      is made a comment character.\item[ini:invalid] Invalid character; this category is for characters that      should not appear in the input. \IniTeX\ assigns the      \ascii\ \gr{delete} character, code~127, to this category.\enumeratestopThe user can change the mapping of character codes to category codeswith the \cstoidx catcode\par\ command (see Chapter~\ref[gramm]for the explanation of concepts such as~\gr{equals}):\disp\cs{catcode}\gram{number}\gr{equals}\gram{number}.\dispstopIn such a statement, the first number is often given in the form\disp\ver>`>\gr{character}\quad or\quad \ver>`\>\gr{character}\dispstopboth of which denote the character code of the character(see pages \pgref[char:code] and~\pgref[int:denotation]).The plain format defines\csterm active\par\Ver>\chardef\active=13<Rev so that one can write statements such as\Ver>\catcode`\{=\active<RevThe \cs{chardef} command is  treatedon pages \pgref[chardef] and~\pgref[num:chardef].The \LaTeX\ format has the control sequences\Ver>\def\makeatletter{\catcode`@=11 }\def\makeatother{\catcode`@=12 }<Revin order to switch on and off the `secret' character~\n@(see below).\awpThe \cs{catcode} command can also be used to query categorycodes: in \Ver>\count255=\catcode`\{<Revit yields a number, which can be assigned.Category codes can be tested by\disp\cs{ifcat}\gr{token$_1$}\gr{token$_2$}\dispstop\TeX\ expands whatever is after \cs{ifcat} until two unexpandable tokens are found; these are then comparedwith respect to their category codes. Control sequencetokens are considered to have category code~16,which makes them all equal to each other, and unequal toall character tokens.Conditionals are treated further in Chapter~\ref[if].\point From characters to tokensThe input processorof \TeX\ scans input lines from a file or from theuser terminal, and converts the characters in the inputto tokens. There are three types of tokens.\itemlist\item Character tokens: any character that is	passed on its own to \TeX'sfurther levels of processing with an appropriatecategory code attached.\item Control sequence tokens, of which there are two kinds:	an escape character \ldash that is,\message{ldash nobreak?}a character of category~0 \rdash  followedby a string of `letters' islumped together into a {\em control word}, which is a single token.An escape character followed by a single character that is not ofcategory~11, letter, is made into a {\em control symbol}\term control symbol\par.If the distinction between control word and control symbol isirrelevant, both are called {\em control sequences}\term control sequence\par.The control symbol that results from an escape character followed\csterm \char32\parby a space character is called {\em control space}\term control space\par.\item Parameter tokens: a parameter character 	\ldash that is, a character of category~6, by default~\ver=#= \rdash followed by a digit \n{1..9} is replaced by a parameter token.Parameter tokens are allowed only in the context ofmacros (see Chapter~\ref[macro]).A macro parameter character followed by another macro parametercharacter (not necessarily with the same character code)is replaced by a single character token.This token has category~6 (macro parameter), and the charactercode of the second parameter character.The most common instance is of this isreplacing \n{\#\#} by~\n{\#$_6$}, where the subscriptdenotes the category code.\itemliststop\point[input:states] The input processor as a finite state automaton\TeX's input processor can be considered to be a finite state automaton with three internal states,that is, at any moment in time it is in one of three states,\term internal states\parand after transition to another state there is no memory of the\awpprevious states. \spoint State {\italic N}: new lineState {\italic N} is entered at the beginning of each new input line,and that is the only time \TeX\ is in this state.In state~{\italic N} all space tokens (that is, characters of category~10)are ignored; an end-of-line character is convertedinto a \cs{par} token.All other tokens bring \TeX\ into state~{\italic M}.\spoint State {\italic S}: skipping spacesState {\italic S} is entered in any mode after a control word orcontrol space (but after no other control symbol),or, when in state~{\italic M}, after a space.In this state all subsequent spaces or end-of-line charactersin this input line are discarded.\spoint State {\italic M}: middle of lineBy far the most common state is~{\italic M}, `middle of line'.It is entered after characters of categories1--4, 6--8, and 11--13, and after control symbolsother than control space.An end-of-line character encountered in this stateresults in a space token.\input figs1 \message{left align flow diagram}\vskip12pt plus 1pt minus 4pt\relax %before spoint skip\tdisp\PopIndentLevel\leavevmode\relax\figmouth\>\point[hathat] Accessing the full character setStrictly speaking, \TeX's input processoris not a finite state automaton.This is because during the scanning of the input lineall trios consisting of two {\sl equal\/} superscript characters \term \char94\char94\ replacement\par(category code~7) and a subsequent character(with character code~$<128$)are replaced by a single character with a charactercode in the range 0--127,differing by 64 from that of the original character.This mechanism can be used, for instance, to access positions in a fontcorresponding to character codes that cannotbe input, for instance because they are \ascii{} control characters.The most obvious examples are the \ascii{} \gr{return}and \gr{delete} characters; the corresponding positions 13 and 127 in a font areaccessible as \ver>^^M> and~\ver>^^?>.However, since the category of \ver>^^?> is 15, invalid,that has to be changed before character 127 can be accessed.\awpIn \TeX3 this mechanism has been modified and extended to access 256 characters:any quadruplet \ver-^^xy- where both \n x and \n y are lowercasehexadecimal digits \n0--\n9, \n a--\n f, is replaced by a character in therange 0--255, namely the character the number of which isrepresented hexadecimally as~\n{xy}.This imposes a slight restriction on the applicabilityof the earlier mechanism: if, for instance, \ver>^^a>is typed to produce character~33, then a following\n0--\n9, \n{a}--\n{f} will be misunderstood.While this process makes \TeX's input processorsomewhat more powerfulthan a true finite state automaton,it does not interfere with the rest ofthe scanning. Therefore it is conceptually simpler to pretend thatsuch a replacement of triplets or quadrupletsof characters, starting with~\ver>^^>, is performed in advance. In actual practice this is not possible,because aninput line may assign category code~7 to some character other than the circumflex, thereby influencing its further processing.\point Transitions between internal statesLet us now discuss the effects on the internal stateof \TeX's input processor whencertain category codes are encountered in the input. \spoint 0: escape characterWhen an escape character is encountered\term escape character\par,\TeX\ starts forming a control sequence token.Three different types of control sequence can result,depending on the category code of the character thatfollows the escape character.\itemlist\itemIf the character following the escape is of category~11,letter, then \TeX\ combines the escape,that character and all followingcharacters of category~11, into a control word.After that \TeX\goes into state~{\italic S}, skipping spaces.\itemWith a character of category~10, space,a control symbol called control space results, and \TeX\ goes into state~{\italic S}.\itemWith a character of any other category code a control symbol results, and \TeX\ goes into state~{\italic M},middle of line.\itemliststopThe letters of a control sequence name have to be all on one line;a control sequence name is not continued on the next lineif the current line ends with a comment sign, or if (by letting\cs{endlinechar} be outside the range~0--255) there is no terminating character.\spoint 1--4, 7--8, 11--13: non-blank charactersCharacters of category codes 1--4, 7--8, and 11--13 are madeinto tokens, and \TeX\ goes into state~{\italic M}.\spoint 5: end of lineUpon encountering an end-of-line character, \TeX\ discards the rest of theline, and starts processing the next line,in state~{\italic N}. If the current state was~{\italic N},\awpthat is, if theline so far contained at most spaces, a~\cs{par} tokenis inserted; if the state was~{\italic M}, a~space token is inserted,and in state~{\italic S} nothing is inserted.Note that by `end-of-line character' a character with categorycode~5 is meant. This is not necessarily the \cs{endlinechar},nor need it appear at the end of the line.See below for further remarks on line ends.\spoint 6: parameterParameter characters \ldash usually~\ver=#= \rdash  can be\term parameter character\parfollowed by either a digit \n{1..9} in the context of macro definitions\alttor by another parameter character. In the first case a `parameter token' results,in the second case only a single parameter characteris passed on as a character token for further processing.In either case \TeX\ goes into state~{\italic M}.A parameter character can also appear on its own in analignment preamble (see Chapter~\ref[align]).\spoint 7: superscriptA superscript character is handled like most non-blankcharacters, except in the case where it is followedby a  superscript character of the same character code.The processthat replaces these two characters plus the following character(possibly two characters in \TeX3) by another characterwas described above.\spoint 9: ignored characterCharacters of category 9 are ignored; \TeX\ remains in the same state.\spoint 10: spaceA token with category code 10 \ldash this is called a \gr{space token},irrespective of the character code \rdash is ignored in states {\italic N} and~{\italic S} (and the state does not change); in state~{\italic M} \TeX\ goes into state~{\italic S}, insertinga token that has category~10 and character code~32 (\ascii{} space)\term space character\par,that is, the character code of the space token may changefrom the character that was actually input.\spoint 14: commentA comment character causes \TeX\ to discard the rest of the line, including the comment character.In particular, the end-of-line character is not seen,so even if the comment was encountered in state~{\italic M}, no spacetoken is inserted.\spoint 15: invalidInvalid characters cause an error message. \TeX\ remains inthe state it was in.However, in the context of a control symbol an invalid characteris acceptable. Thus \ver>\^^?> does not cause any error messages.\awp\point[cat12] Letters and other charactersIn most programming languages identifiers can consistof both letters and digits (and possibly some othercharacter such as the underscore), but control sequences in \TeX\are only allowed to be formed out of characters of category~11,letter. Ordinarily, the digits and punctuation symbols havecategory~12, other character.However, there are contexts where \TeX\ itselfgenerates a string of characters, all of which havecategory code~12, even if that is not their usualcategory code.This happens when the operations \cs{string},\cs{number},\cs{romannumeral},\cs{jobname},\cs{fontname},\cs{meaning},and \cs{the}are used to generate a stream of character tokens.If any of the characters delivered by such a commandis a space character (that is, character code~32), it receives category code~10, space.For the extremely rare case where a hexadecimal digit has beenhidden in a control sequence, \TeX\ allows \n A$_{12}$--\n F$_{12}$to be hexadecimal digits, in addition to the ordinary\n A$_{11}$--\n F$_{11}$ (herethe subscripts denote the category codes).For example,\disp\ver>\string\end>\quad gives four character tokens\quad\n{\char92$_{12}$e$_{12}$n$_{12}$d$_{12}$} \dispstopNote that\n{\char92$_{12}$}\term escape character\par\label[use:escape]is used in the output only because thevalue of \cs{escapechar} is the character code for thebackslash. Another value of \cs{escapechar} leads to anothercharacter in the output of \cs{string}. The \cs{string} command is treated further in Chapter~\ref[char].Spaces can wind up in control sequences:\disp\ver>\csname a b\endcsname>\dispstop gives a control sequencetoken in which one of the three characters is a space.Turning this control sequence token into a string of characters\disp\ver>\expandafter\string\csname a b\endcsname>\dispstopgives \n{\char92$_{12}$a$_{12}$\char32$_{10}$b$_{12}$}.As a more practical example, suppose there exists a sequenceof input files \n{file1.tex}, \n{file2.tex}\label[ex:jobnumber],and we want towrite a macro that finds the number of the input filethat is being processed. One approach would be to write\Ver>\newcount\filenumber  \def\getfilenumber file#1.{\filenumber=#1 }\expandafter\getfilenumber\jobname.<Revwhere the letters \n{file} in the parameter text of themacro (see Section~\ref[param:text]) absorb that part of thejobname, leaving the number as the sole parameter.However, this is slightly incorrect: the letters \n{file} resultingfrom the \cs{jobname} command have category code~12, instead of11 for the ones in the definition of \cs{getfilenumber}.This can be repaired as follows:\Ver>{\escapechar=-1 \expandafter\gdef\expandafter\getfilenumber       \string\file#1.{\filenumber=#1 }}<Rev\awpNow the sequence \ver>\string\file> gives the fourletters \n{f$_{12}$i$_{12}$l$_{12}$e$_{12}$}; the \cs{expandafter} commands let this be executed prior tothe macro definition;the backslash is omitted because we put \ver>\escapechar=-1>.Confining this value to a group makes it necessary to use~\cs{gdef}.%\global\def\pppar.{\par}\point The \lowercase{\n{\char92par}} token\TeX\ inserts a \cstoidx par\par\ token into the input after\term empty lines\parencountering a character with category code~5,end of line, in state~{\italic N}.It is good to realize when exactly this happens:since \TeX\ leaves state~{\italic N}when it encounters any token but a space,a~line giving a \cs{par} can only contain charactersof category~10. In particular, it cannot end with a commentcharacter. Quite often this fact is used the other way around:if an empty line is wanted for the layout of the inputone can put a comment sign on that line.Two consecutive empty lines generate two \cs{par} tokens.For all practical purposes this is equivalent to one \cs{par},because after the first one \TeX\ enters vertical mode, andin vertical mode a \cs{par} onlyexercises the page builder,and clears the paragraph shape parameters.A \cs{par} is also inserted into the input when \TeX\ sees a\gram{vertical command} in unrestricted horizontal mode.After the \cs{par} has been read and expanded, thevertical command is examined anew (see Chapters~\ref[hvmode]and~\ref[par:end]).The \cs{par} token may also be inserted by the \cs{end}command that finishes off the run of \TeX; see Chapter~\ref[output].It is important to realize that \TeX\ does what it normally doeswhen encountering an empty line(which is ending a paragraph)only because of the default definition of the \cs{par} token.By redefining \cs{par} the behaviourcaused by empty lines and vertical commands can be changed completely,and  interesting special effects can be achieved.In order to continue to be able  to cause the actions normallyassociated with \cs{par}, the synonym \cs{endgraf} isavailable in the plain format. See further Chapter~\ref[par:end].The \cs{par} token is not allowed to be part of a macroargument, unless the macro has been declared to be \cs{long}.A \cs{par} in the argument of a non-\cs{long} macroprompts \TeX\ to give a `runaway argument' message.Control sequences that have been \cs{let} to \cs{par}(such as \cs{endgraf}) are allowed, however.\point SpacesThis section treats some of the aspects of\term space tokens\parspace characters and space tokens in the initial processingstages of \TeX. The topic of spacing in text typesettingis treated in Chapter~\ref[space].\spoint Skipped spacesFrom the discussion of the internal states of \TeX's input processorit is clear that some spaces in the input never reach the\awpoutput; in fact they never get past the input processor.These are for instance the spaces at the beginningof an input line, and the spaces following the onethat lets \TeX\ switch to state~{\italic S}.On the other hand, line ends can generate spaces (which are notin the input) that may wind up in the output.There is a third kind of space: the spaces that get past theinput processor,or are even generated there, but still do not wind up in theoutput. These are the \gram{optional spaces} that the syntax of \TeX\ allows in various places.\spoint Optional spacesThe syntax of \TeX\ has the concepts of `optional spaces'\term space, optional \parand `one optional space':\disp\gr{one optional space} $\longrightarrow$\gr{space token} $|$ \gr{empty}\nl\gr{optional spaces} $\longrightarrow$\gr{empty} $|$ \gr{space token}\gr{optional spaces}\dispstopIn general, \gr{one optional space} is allowed afternumbers and glue specifications, while \gr{optional spaces} areallowed whenever a space can occur inside a number(for example, between a minus sign and the digits of the number)or glue specification (for example, between \n{plus} and \n{1fil}).Also, the definition of \gr{equals} allows \gr{optional spaces}before the \n= sign.Here are some examples of optional spaces.\itemlist \item A number can be delimited by \gr{one optional space}. This prevents accidents (see Chapter~\ref[number]), and it speeds up processing, as \TeX\ can detect more easily where the \gram{number} being read ends.Note, however, that not every `number' is a \gram{number}:for instance the {\tt 2} in \cs{magstep2} is not a number,but the  single token that is the parameter of the\cs{magstep} macro. Thus a space or line end after thisis significant. Another example is a parameter number,for example~\n{\#1}: since at most nine parameters are allowed, scanningone digit after the parameter character suffices.\item From the grammar of \TeX\ it follows that thekeywords \n{fill} and \n{filll}consist of \n{fil} andseparate {\tt l}$\,$s, each of which is a keyword(see page~\pgref[keywords] for a more elaborate discussion),and hence can be followed by optional spaces. Therefore forms such as \hbox{\n{fil L l}} are also valid.This is a potential source of strange accidents.In most cases, appending a \cs{relax} token preventssuch mishaps.\item The primitive command \cstoidx ignorespaces\par\ may come in handy as the final command in a macro definition.As it gobbles upoptional spaces, it can be used to prevent spaces following theclosing brace of an argument from winding up in the outputinadvertently. For example, in\Ver>\def\item#1{\par\leavevmode    \llap{#1\enspace}\ignorespaces}\item{a/}one line \item{b/} another line \item{c/}yet another<Rev the \cs{ignorespaces} prevents spuriousspaces in the second and third item.An empty lineafter \cs{ignorespaces} will still insert a \cs{par}, however.\itemliststop\awp\spoint Ignored and obeyed spacesAfter control words spaces are ignored. This is not aninstance of optional spaces, but it is due to the fact that\TeX\ goes into state~{\italic S}, skipping spaces, after controlwords. Similarly an end-of-line character is skippedafter a control word.Numbers are delimited by only \gr{one optional space},but still\disp\n{a\char92 count0=3\char32\char32b}\quad gives\quad `ab',\>because \TeX\ goes into state~{\italic S} after the firstspace token. The second space is therefore skipped in the input processor of \TeX; it never becomes a space token.Spaces are skipped furthermore when \TeX\ is in state~{\italic N},newline. When \TeX\ is processing in vertical modespace tokens (that is, spaces that were not skipped)are ignored. For example, the space inserted after the first box in\Ver>\par\hbox{a}\hbox{b}<Rev has no effect.Both plain \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ define a command \cs{obeyspaces}\alttthat makes spaces significant: after one space other spaces are nolonger ignored. In both cases the basis is\altt\Ver>\catcode`\ =13 \def {\space}<RevHowever, there is a difference between the two cases:in plain \TeX\ \Ver>\def\space{ }<Revwhile in \LaTeX\ \Ver>\def\space{\leavevmode{} }<Revalthough the macros bear other names there.The difference between the two macros becomesapparent in the context of \cs{obeylines}:each line end is then a \cs{par} command, implying thateach next line is started in vertical mode.An active space is expanded by the plain macro to a space token, which is ignored in vertical mode.The active spaces in \LaTeX\ will immediately switch to horizontalmode, so that each space is significant.\spoint More ignored spacesThere are three further places where \TeX\ will ignore space tokens.\alt\enumerate\item When \TeX\ is looking foran undelimited macro argument it will accept thefirst token (or group) that is not a space. This is treatedin Chapter~\ref[macro].\item In math mode space tokens are ignored (see Chapter~\ref[math]).\item After an alignment tab character spaces are ignored(see Chapter~\ref[align]).\>\awp\spoint \gr{space token}Spaces are anomalous in \TeX.For instance, the \cs{string} operation assigns category code~12 to allcharacters except spaces; they receive category~10.Also, as was said above, \TeX's input processor converts (when instate~{\italic M}) all tokens with category code~10 into real spaces:they get character code~32.Any character token with category~10 is called\gram{space token}\term space token\par.Space tokens with charactercode not equal to 32 are called `funny spaces'\term funny spaces\par.\example After giving the character \n Q the category code of a space character, and using it in a definition\Ver>\catcode`Q=10 \def\q{aQb}<Revwe get\Ver>\show\qmacro:-> a b<Revbecause the input processorchanges the character code of the funny spacein the definition.\>Space tokens with character codes other than 32 can becreated using, for instance, \cs{uppercase}.However, `since the various forms ofspace tokens are almost identical in behaviour, there's nopoint dwelling on the details'; see~\cite(p.~377)[K:book].\spoint Control spaceThe `control space' command \ver-\-\n{\char32}\csterm\char32\par\contributes the amount of space that a \gr{space token} wouldwhen the \ver=\spacefactor= is~1000.A~control spaceis not treated like a space token, or like a macroexpanding to one (which is how \cs{space} is defined in plain \TeX).For instance, \TeX\ ignores spacesat the beginning of an input line, butcontrol space is a \gr{horizontal command}, so it makes \TeX\ switch from vertical to horizontal mode(and insert an indentation box).See  Chapter~\ref[space] for the space factor.\spoint `\n{\char32}'The explicit symbol `\n{\char32}' for a spaceis character~32 in the Computer Modern typewriter typeface.However, switching to \cs{tt} is not sufficient to getspaces denoted this way, because spaces will stillreceive special treatment in the input processor.One way tolet spaces be typeset by \n{\char32}is to set \Ver>\catcode`\ =12<Rev\TeX\ will then take a space as the instruction totypeset character number~32. Moreover, subsequent spacesare not skipped, but also typeset this way: state~{\italic S}\awpis only entered after a character with category code~10.Similarly, spaces after a control sequence are madevisible by changing the category code of the space character.\point More about line ends\TeX\ accepts lines from an input file, excluding any lineterminator that may be used\term line ends\par.Because of this, \TeX's behaviour here is not dependenton the operating system and the line terminator it uses (\key{CR}-\key{LF},\key{LF}, or none at all for block storage).From the input line any trailing spaces are removed.The reason for this is historic; it has to do with the block storage mode on \key{IBM} mainframe computers.For some computer-specific problems with end-of-linecharacters, see~\cite[B:ctrl-M].A~terminator character is then appendedwith a character code of \cs{endlinechar}, unless this parameter has a value thatis negative or more than~255. Note that this terminator characterneed not have category code~5, end of line.\spoint ObeylinesEvery once in a while it is desirable that the line ends in\message{Check spurious space obeylines+1}%\csterm obeylines\par\howto Change the meaning of the line end\parthe input correspond to those in the output.The following piece of code does the trick:\Ver>\catcode`\^^M=13 %\def^^M{\par}% <RevThe \cs{endlinechar} character is here made active,and its meaning becomes \cs{par}.The comment signs prevent \TeX\ from seeing the terminator of the\altlines of this definition, and expanding it since it is active.However, it takes some care to embed this code in a macro.The definition\Ver>\def\obeylines{\catcode`\^^M=13 \def^^M{\par}}<Revwill be misunderstood:\TeX\ will discard everythingafter the second \ver>^^M>, because this has category code~5.Effectively, this line is then\Ver>\def\obeylines{\catcode`\^^M=13 \def<RevTo remedy this,the definition itself has to beperformed in a context where \ver>^^M> is an activecharacter:\Ver>{\catcode`\^^M=13 % \gdef\obeylines{\catcode`\^^M=13 \def^^M{\par}}%}<RevEmpty lines in the  input are not taken into accountin this definition: these disappear, because two consecutive \cs{par}tokens are (in this case) equivalent to one. A slightly modified definition for the line end as\Ver>\def^^M{\par\leavevmode}<Rev remedies this:now every line end forces \TeX\ to start a paragraph. For emptylines this will then be an empty paragraph.\awp\spoint Changing the \cs{\endlinechar}Occasionally you may want to change the \cs{endlinechar}, orthe \cs{catcode} of the ordinary line terminator \ver.^^M.,for instance to obtain special effects such as macros where the argument is terminated by the line end.See page~\pgref[pick:eol] for a worked-out example.There are  a couple of traps. Consider the following:\Ver>{\catcode`\^^M=12 \endlinechar=`\^^J \catcode`\^^J=5...... }<RevThis causes unintended output of both character~13 (\ver-^^M-)and~10 (\ver-^^J-), caused by the line terminators of thefirst and last line.Terminating the first and  last line with a comment works,but replacing the first line by the two lines\Ver>{\endlinechar=`\^^J \catcode`\^^J=5\catcode`\^^M=12<Rev is also a solution.Of course, in many cases it is not necessary to substituteanother end-of-line character; a~much simpler solution is then to put \Ver>\endlinechar=-1 <Revwhich treats all lines as if they end with a comment.\spoint More remarks about the end-of-line characterThe character that \TeX\ appends at the end of an input lineis treated like any other character. Usually one is not awareof this, as its category code is special, but there are a fewways to let it be processed in an unusual way.\example Terminating an input line with \ver>^^> will(ordinarily, when \cs{endlinechar} is~13) give `M' in the output, which is the \ascii{} character with code~13+64.\>\example If \ver>\^^M> has been defined,terminating an input line with a backslash will execute this command.The plain format defines\Ver>\def\^^M{\ }<Revwhich makes a `control return' equivalent to a control space.\>\point More about the input processor\spoint The input processor as a separate process\TeX's levels of processing are all working at the\awpsame time and incrementally, but conceptually they can often beconsidered to be separate processes that each accept thecompleted output of the previous stage. The juggling withspaces provides a nice illustration for this.Consider the definition\Ver>\def\DoAssign{\count42=800}<Revand the call\Ver>\DoAssign 0<Rev The input processor, the partof \TeX\ that builds tokens, in scanning this callskips the space before the zero, so the expansion of thiscall is \Ver>\count42=8000<Rev It would be incorrect to reason`\cs{DoAssign} is read, then expanded, the space delimits thenumber 800, so 800 is assigned and the zero is printed'.Note that the same would happen if the zero appeared on the next line.Another illustration shows that optional spaces appear in a differentstage of processing from that for skipped spaces:\disp\ver>\def\c.{\relax}>\nl     \ver>a\c.>{\tt\char32 b}\>expands to\disp\n{a\cs{relax}\char32 b}\dispstopwhich gives as output\disp `a b'\dispstopbecause spaces after the \cs{relax} control sequence are onlyskipped when the line is first read, not when it is expanded.The fragment\disp \ver-\def\c.{\ignorespaces}-\nl \ver-a\c. b-\dispstopon the other hand, expands to\disp\n{a\cs{ignorespaces}\char32 b}\dispstopExecuting the \cs{ignorespaces} command removes the subsequentspace token, so the output is \disp `ab'.\dispstopIn both definitionsthe period after \cs{c} is a delimiting token; it is used hereto prevent spaces from being skipped.\spoint The input processor not as a separate processConsidering the tokenizing of \TeX\ to be a separate processis a convenient view, but sometimes it leads to confusion.The line \Ver>\catcode`\^^M=13{}<Rev\awpmakes the line end active,and subsequently gives an `undefined control sequence' errorfor the line end of this line itself. Execution of the commandson the line thus influences the scanning process of thatsame line.By contrast, \Ver>\catcode`\^^M=13<Rev does not give an error.The reason for this is that \TeX\ reads the line end while it is stillscanning the number~13; that is, at a time when the assignmenthas not been performed yet.The line end is then converted to the optional space characterdelimiting the number to be assigned.\spoint Recursive invocation of the input processorAbove, the activity of replacing a parametercharacter plus a digit by a parameter token was describedas something similar to the lumping together of lettersinto  a control sequence token. Reality is somewhat morecomplicated than this. \TeX's token scanning mechanismis invoked both for input from file and for input fromlists of tokens such as the macro definition. Only in thefirst case is the terminology of internal states applicable.Macro parameter characters are treated the same in bothcases, however. If this were not the case it wouldnot be possible to write things such as\Ver>\def\a{\def\b{\def\c####1{####1}}}<RevSee page \pgref[nest:def] for an explanation of suchnested definitions.\point The \ver-@- conventionAnyone who has ever browsed through either the plain format orthe \LaTeX\ format will have noticed that a lot of control sequencescontain an `at' sign:~\ver-@-. These are control sequences thatare meant to be inaccessible to the ordinary user.Near the beginning of the format files the instruction\Ver>\catcode`@=11<Rev occurs, making the at sign into a letter,meaning that it can be used in control sequences. Somewhere near theend of the format definition the at sign is made `other' again:\Ver>\catcode`@=12<RevNow why is it that users cannotcall a control sequence with an at signdirectly, although they can call macros that contain lots of those`at-definitions'? The reason is that the control sequencescontaining an \n@ are internalized by \TeX\ at definition time,after which they are a token, not a string of characters. Macro expansion thenjust inserts such tokens, and at that time the category codesof the constituent characters do not matter any more.\endinput
