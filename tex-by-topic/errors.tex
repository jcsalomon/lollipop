\subject[error]  Errors, Catastrophes, \nl  and HelpWhen \TeX\ is running, various errors can occur.This chapter treats how errors in the input are displayed,and what sort of overflow of internal data structuresof \TeX\ can occur.\invent\item errorcontextlines       (\TeX3 only)      Number of additional context lines shown in error messages.\item errmessage       Report an error, giving the parameter of this command as message.\item errhelp       Tokens that will be displayed if the user       asks further help after an \cs{errmessage}.\inventstop\point Error messagesWhen \TeX\ is running in \cs{errorstopmode} (which it usually is;see Chapter~\ref[run] for the other running modes),errors occurring are reported on the user terminal, and \TeX\asks the user for further instructions.Errors can occur either because of some internal conditionof \TeX, or because a macro has issued an \cs{errmessage}\csterm errmessage\parcommand.If an error occurs \TeX\ shows the input \term error patching\parline on which the error occurred. If the offending command wasnot on that line but, for instance, in a macro that wascalled \ldash possibly indirectly \rdash  from that line,the line of that command is also shown.If the offending command was indirectly called,\csterm errorcontextlines\paran additional \cs{errorcontextlines} number of linesis shown with the preceding macro calls.A~value of \cs{errorcontextlines}${}=0$ causes \n{...}to be printed as the sole indication that there is a context.Negative values inhibit even this.For each macro in the sequence that leads to the offendingcommand,\TeX\ attempts to display somepreceding and some following tokens.First one line is displayed ending withthe \ldash indirectly \rdash  offending command; then, one line lowersome following tokens are given. \example\Ver>This paragraph ends \vship1cm with a skip.<Revgives\Ver>! Undefined control sequence.l.1 This paragraph ends \vship                              1cm with a skip.<Rev\>If \TeX\ is not running in some non-stop mode\label[interaction],the user is given the chance to patch errors or toask for further information. In general the followingoptions are available:\description\item \gr{return}\TeX\ will continue processing. If the error was somethinginnocent that \TeX\ could either ignore or patch itself,this is the easy way out.\item \n hGive further details about the error.If the error was caused by an \cs{err\-message} command,\csterm errhelp\parthe \cs{errhelp} tokens will be displayed here.\item \n iInsert. The user can insert some material. For example,if a control sequence is misspelled, the correct command cansometimes be inserted, as \Ver>i\vskip<Rev for the aboveexample. Also, this is an opportunity for inserting\cs{show} commands to inspect \TeX's internal state.However, if \TeX\ is in the middle ofscanning something complicated,such commands will not be executed, or will evenadd to the confusion.\item \n s    (\cs{scrollmode})Scroll further errors, but display the messages. \TeX\ will patch any further errors.This is a handy option, for instance if the error occursin an alignment, because the number of subsequent errors tendsto be rather large.\item \n r    (\cs{nonstopmode})Run without stopping. \TeX\ will never stop for user interaction.\item \n q    (\cs{batchmode})Quiet running. \TeX\ will never stop for user interaction,and does not give any more terminal output.\item \n xExit. Abort this run of \TeX.\item \n eEdit. This option is not available on all \TeX\ system.If it is, the run of \TeX\ is aborted, and an editor isstarted, opening with the input file, maybe even on the offending line.\descriptionstop\point Overflow errorsHarsh reality imposes some restrictions on how elaborate\term overflow errors\par\TeX's workings can get. Some restrictions are imposed bycompile-time constants, and are therefore fairly loose, butsome depend strongly on the actual computer implementation.Here follows the list of all categories of overflow thatprompt \TeX\ to report `Capacity exceeded'.Most bounds involved are (determined by) compile-timeconstants; their values given here in parentheses are thoseused in the source listing of \TeX\ in~\cite[K:book].Actual values may differ, and probably will. Rememberthat \TeX\ was developed in the good old days when evenbig computers were fairly small.\spoint Buffer size {\rm(500)}Current lines of all files that are open are kept in\TeX's input buffer, as are control sequence namesthat are being built with \ver-\csname...\endcsname-.\spoint Exception dictionary {\rm(307)}The maximum number of hyphenation exceptions specifiedby \cs{hyphenation} must be a prime number.Two arrays with this many halfwords are allocated.Changing this  number makes formats incompatible;that is, \TeX\ can only use a format that was made byan \IniTeX\ with the same value for this constant.\spoint Font memory (20$\,$000)Information about fonts is stored in an array ofmemory words. This is easily overflowed by preloading toomany fonts in \IniTeX.\spoint Grouping levelsThe number of open groups  should be recordable in a quarter word. There is no compile-time constant correspondingto this.\spoint Hash size {\rm(2100)}Maximum number of control sequences. It is suggested thatthis number should not exceed 10\% of the main memory size.The values in \TeX\ and \IniTeX\ should agree; also the\n{hash\_prime} values should agree.This value is rather low; for macro packages that are moreelaborate than plain \TeX\ a value of about 3000 is morerealistic.\spoint Number of strings {\rm(3000)}The maximum number of strings must be recordable in a half word.\spoint Input stack size {\rm(200)}For each input source an item is allocated on the input stack.Typical input sources are input files (but their simultaneousnumber is more limited; see below), and token listssuch as token variables, macro replacement texts, andalignment templates. A~macro with `runaway recursion'(for example, \ver>\def\mac{{\mac}}>)will overflow this stack.\TeX\ performs some optimization here: before the last call in a token list all token lists ending with this call arecleared. This process is similar to `resolving tail recursion' (see Chapter~\ref[macro]).\spoint Main memory size (30$\,$000)Almost all `dynamic' objects of \TeX, such as macro definitiontexts and all material on the current page, are stored in the main memory array. Formats may already take $20\,000$ words ofmain memory for macro definitions, and complicated pages containingfor instance the \LaTeX\ picture environment may easilyoverflow this array. \TeX's main memory is divided in words, and a half wordis supposed to be able to address the whole of the memory.Thus on current 32-bit computers the most common choiceis to let the main memory size be at most 64K bytes.A~half word address can then be stored in 16 bits,half a machine word.However, so-called `Big \TeX' implementations exist\term big \TeX\parthat have a main memory larger than 64K words.Most compilers will then allocate  32-bit words foraddressing this memory, even if (say) 18 bits wouldsuffice. Big \TeX s therefore become immediatelya lot bigger when they cross the 64K threshold.Thus they are usually not found on microcomputers,although virtual memory schemes for these are possible;see for instance~\cite[Thull].\TeX\ can have a bigger main memory than \IniTeX;see Chapter~\ref[TeXcomm] for further details.\spoint Parameter stack size {\rm(60)}Macro parameters may contain macro calls withfurther parameters. The number of parameters that may occurnested is bounded by the parameter stack size.\spoint Pattern memory {\rm(8000)}Hyphenation patterns are stored in a trie array.The default size of 8000 hyphenation patterns seems sufficientfor English or Italian,  for example, but it is not forDutch or German.\spoint Pattern memory ops per languageThe number of hyphenation ops (see the literature abouthyphenation: \cite[Liang] and appendix~H of~\cite[K:book])should be recordable in a quarter word. There is no compile-time constant correspondingto this. \TeX\ version~2 had the same upper bound, but gave noerror message in case of overflow. Again, for languages suchas Dutch and German this bound is too low.There are versions of \TeX\ that have a higher bound here.\spoint Pool size (32$\,$000)Strings are error messages and control sequence names.They are stored using one byte per character.\TeX\ has initially about $23\,000$ characters worth ofstrings.The pool will overflow if a user defines a large number ofcontrol sequences on top of a substantial macro package.However, even if the user does not define any new commandsoverflow may occur: cross"-referencing schemes alsowork by defining control sequences. For large documentsa pool size of $40\,000$ or $60\,000$ is probably sufficient.\spoint Save size {\rm(600)}Quantities that are assigned to inside a group must berestored after the end of that group.The save stack is where the values to be restored are kept;the size of thesave stack limits the number of values that can be restored.Alternating global and local assignments to a valuewill lead to `save stack build-up': for each localassignment following a global assignment theprevious value of the variable is saved. Thus analternation of such assignments will lead toan unnecessary proliferation of items on the save stack.\spoint Semantic nest size {\rm(40)}Each time \TeX\ switches to a mode nested inside anothermode (for instance when processing an \ver-\hbox- insidea \ver-\vbox-) the current state is pushed on thesemantic nest stack. The semantic nest size is the maximumnumber of levels that can be pushed.\spoint Text input levels {\rm(6)}The number of nested \ver-\input- files has to be very limited,as the current lines are all kept in the input buffer.\endinput
