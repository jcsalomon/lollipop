\subject[run] Running \TeXThis chapter treats the run modes of \TeX, and someother commands associated with the job being processed.\invent\item everyjob       Token list that is inserted at the start of each new job.\item jobname       Name of the main \TeX\ file being processed.\item end       Command to finish off a run of \TeX.\item bye      Plain \TeX\ macro to force the final output.\item pausing       Specify that \TeX\ should pause after each line that is       read from a file.\item errorstopmode      \TeX\ will ask for user input on the occurrence of an error.\item scrollmode       \TeX\ fixes errors itself,      but will ask the user for missing files.\item nonstopmode       \TeX\ fixes errors itself,       and performs an emergency stop on serious errors       such as missing input files.\item batchmode       \TeX\ fixes errors itself       and performs an emergency stop on serious errors       such as missing input files,      but no terminal output is generated.\inventstop\point Jobs\TeX\ associates with each run a name for the file\term job\par\csterm jobname\parbeing processed: the \cs{jobname}. If \TeX\ is runinteractively\ldash meaning that it has been invoked without a file argument,and the user types commands \rdashthe jobname is \n{texput}.The \cs{jobname} can be used to generatethe names of auxiliary files to be read orwritten during the run. For instance, for a file \n{story.tex}the \cs{jobname} is \n{story}, and writing\Ver>\openout\Auxiliary=\jobname.aux\openout\TableOfContents=\jobname.toc<Revwill create the files \n{story.aux} and \n{story.toc}.\spoint Start of the job\TeX\ starts each job by inserting the \cs{everyjob} token\csterm everyjob\parlist into the command stream.Setting this variable during a run of \TeX\ has no use,but a format can use it to identify itself to the user.If aformat fills the token list, the commands therein are automaticallyexecuted when \TeX\ is run using that format.\spoint End of the jobA \TeX\ job is terminated by the \cs{end} command. This\csterm end\parmay involve first forcing the output routine to process anyremaining material (see Chapter~\ref[page:break]).If the end of job occurs inside a group\TeX\ will give a diagnosticmessage. The \cs{end} command is not allowed in internalvertical mode, because this would be inside a vertical box.Usually some sugar coating of the \cs{end} command is necessary.\csterm bye\parFor instance the plain \TeX\ macro \cs{bye} is definedas \Ver>\def\bye{\par\vfill\supereject\end}<Revwhere the \cs{supereject} takes care of any leftover insertions.\spoint The log fileFor each run \TeX\ creates a log file. Usually this will be\term log file\para file with as name the value of \cs{jobname}, and theextension \n{.log}. Other extensions such as \n{.lis}are used by some implementations.This log file contains all information thatis displayed on the screen during the run of \TeX, butit will display some information more elaborately, and itcan contain statistics that are usually not displayed onthe screen. If the parameter \cs{tracingonline}has a positive value, all the log file information will beshown on the screen.Overfull and underfull boxes are reported on the terminalscreen, and they are dumped using the parameters\cs{showboxdepth} and \cs{showboxbreadth} in the log file(see Chapter~\ref[trace]). These parameters are also usedfor box dumps caused by the \cs{showbox} command, andfor the dump of boxes written by \cs{shipout} if \cs{tracingoutput} is set to a positive value.Statistics generated by commands such as \cs{tracingparagraphs}will be written to the log file; if \cs{tracingonline} is positivethey will also be shown on the screen.Output operations to a stream that is not open, or to astream with a number that is not in the range 0--15,go to the log file. If the stream number is positive,they also go to the terminal.\point Run modesBy default, \TeX\ goes into \cs{errorstopmode} if an error occurs:\term run modes\par\csterm errorstopmode\parit stops and asks for input from the user. Some implementations  have a way of forcing \TeX\ into errorstopmodewhen the user interrupts \TeX, so thatthe internal state of \TeX\ can be inspected (and altered). See page~\pgref[interaction] for ways to switch the runmode when \TeX\ has been interrupted.Often, \TeX\ canfix an error itself if the user asks \TeX\ just to continue(usually by hitting the return key),but sometimes (for instance in alignments)it may take a while before \TeX\ is on theright track again (and sometimes it never is).In such cases the user may want toturn on \cs{scrollmode},\csterm scrollmode\parwhich instructs \TeX\ to fix as best it can anyoccurring error without confirmation from the user.This is usually done by typing `s' when \TeX\ asksfor input.In \cs{scrollmode}, \TeX\ also does not ask for inputafter \cs{show...} commands.\altHowever, some errors, such as a file that could not befound for \cs{input}, are not so easily remedied, sothe user will still be asked for input.With \cs{nonstopmode} \TeX\ will scroll through errors and,\csterm nonstopmode\parin the case of the kind of error that cannot be recovered from,it will make an emergency stop, aborting the run.Also \TeX\ will abort the run if a \cs{read} is attemptedfrom the terminal.\csterm batchmode\parThe \cs{batchmode} differs only from nonstopmode in thatit gives messages only to the log file, not to the terminal.\subject[TeXcomm] \TeX\ and the \nl Outside WorldThischapter treats those commands that bear relevance to\n{dvi} files and formats. It gives some global informationabout \IniTeX, font and format files,Computer Modern typefaces, and \web.\invent\item dump       Dump a format file; possible only in \IniTeX,       not allowed inside a group.\item special       Write a \gr{balanced text} to the \n{dvi} file.\item mag       1000 times the magnification of the document.\item year       The year of the current job.\item month       The month of the current job.\item day       The day of the current job.\item time      Number of minutes after midnight that the current job started.\item fmtname       Macro containing the name of the format dumped.\item fmtversion       Macro containing the version of the format dumped.\inventstop\point \TeX, \IniTeX, \VirTeXIn the terminology established in {\italic \TeX: the Program},\cite[K:program],\term\TeX\par\term\IniTeX\par\term\VirTeX\par\TeX\ programs come in three flavours.\IniTeX\ is a version of \TeX\ that can generate formats;\VirTeX\ is a production version without preloaded format,and \TeX\ is a production version with preloaded (plain) format. Unfortunately, this terminology isnot adhered to in general. A~lot of systems do not use preloadedformats (the procedure for making them may be impossible onsome operating systems),and call the `virgin \TeX' simply \TeX.This manual also follows that convention.\spoint Formats: loadingA format file (usually with extension~\n{.fmt})is a compact dump of \TeX's internal structures.\term format files\parLoading a format file takes a considerably shorter time thanwould be needed forloading the font information and the macros thatconstitute the format.Both \TeX\ and \IniTeX\ can load a format; the user specifiesthis by putting the name on the command line \Ver>% tex &plain <Revor at the \n{**} prompt\Ver>% texThis is TeX. Version ....** &plain <Revpreceded by an ampersand (for UNIX, this should be \ver>\&> onthe command line). An input file name can follow theformat name in both places.\IniTeX\ does not need a format,but if no format is specified for (Vir)\TeX, it will try toload the plain format, and halt if that cannot be found.\spoint Formats: dumping\IniTeX\ is the only version of \TeX\ that can dump a format, since it isthe only version of \TeX\ that has\csterm dump\parthe command~\cs{dump},which causes the internal structuresto be dumped as a format.It is also the only version of \TeX\ that has the command\cs{patterns}, whichis needed to specify a list of hyphenationpatterns.Dumping is not allowed inside a group, that is\Ver>{ ... \dump }<Rev is not allowed. This restrictionprevents difficulties with \TeX's save stack.After the \cs{dump} command \TeX\ gives an elaborate listing ofits internal state, and of the font names associated withfonts that have been loaded and ends the job.An interesting possibility arises from the fact that\IniTeX\ can both load and dump a format.Suppose you have written a set of macros that buildon top of plain \TeX, \n{superplain.tex}.You could then call\Ver>% initex &plain superplain*\dump<Revand get a format file \n{superplain.fmt} thathas all of plain, and all of your macros.\spoint Formats: preloadingOn some systems it is possible to interrupt a running program,and save its `core image' such that this can be started asan independent program. The executable made from thecore image of a \TeX\ program interrupted after it has loaded a format is called a \TeX\ program with preloaded format.The idea behind preloaded formats isthat interrupting \TeX\ after it has loaded a format, and makingthis program available to the user, saves in each run the time for loading the format.In the good old days when computers were quite a bit slowerthis procedure made sense.Nowadays, it does not seem so necessary.Besides, dumping a core image may not always be possible.\spoint The knowledge of \IniTeXIf no format has been loaded, \IniTeX\ knows very little.For instance, it has no open/close group characters.However, it can not be completely devoid of knowledgelest there be no way to define anything.Here is the extent of its knowledge.\itemlist \mathsurround=1.5pt\flushright:no\item \ver>\catcode`\\=0>, \ver>\escapechar=`\\>      (see page~\pgref[ini:esc]).\item \ver>\catcode`\^^M=5>, \ver>\endlinechar=`\^^M>      (see page~\pgref[ini:eol]).\item \ver>\catcode`\ =10>      (see page~\pgref[ini:sp]).\item \ver>\catcode`\%=14>      (see page~\pgref[ini:comm]).\item \ver>\catcode`\^^?=15>      (see page~\pgref[ini:invalid]).\item \cs{catcode}$x$\n{=11} for $x={}$\n{`a..`z,`A..`Z}      (see page~\pgref[ini:let]).\item \cs{catcode}$x$\n{=12} for all other character codes\nl      (see page~\pgref[ini:other]).\item \cs{sfcode}$x$=\n{999} for $x={}$\n{`A..`Z},      \cs{sfcode}$x$\n{=1000} for all other characters      (see page~\pgref[ini:sf]).\item \ver>\lccode`a..`z,`A..`Z=`a..`z>, \ver>\uccode`a..`z,`A..`Z=`A..`Z>,      \cs{lccode}$x$\n{=0}, \cs{uccode}$x$\n{=0} for all other characters      (see page~\pgref[ini:uclc]).\item \ver>\delcode`.=0>, \cs{delcode}$x$\n{=-1} for all other characters      (see page~\pgref[ini:del]).\item \cs{mathcode}$x$\n{="!7100}${}+x$ for all lowercase and uppercase      letters, \cs{mathcode}$x$\n{="!7000}${}+x$ for all digits,      \cs{mathcode}$x$\n=$x$ for all other characters      (see page~\pgref[ini:fam]).\item \cs{tolerance=10000}, \cs{mag=1000},      \cs{maxdeadcycles=25}.\>\spoint Memory sizes of \TeX\ and \IniTeXThe main memory size of \TeX\ and \IniTeX\ is controlled byfour constants in the source code:\n{mem\_bot}, \n{mem\_top}, \n{mem\_min}, and~\n{mem\_max}.For Ini\TeX's memory \n{mem\_bot${}={}$mem\_min} and \n{mem\_top${}={}$mem\_max};for \TeX\ \n{mem\_bot} and \n{mem\_top} record the main memorysize of the Ini\TeX\ used to dump the format.Thus versions of \TeX\ and \IniTeX\ have to be adaptedto each other in this    respect.\TeX's own main memory can be bigger than that of thecorresponding \IniTeX: in general\n{mem\_min${}\leq{}$mem\_bot} and \n{mem\_top${}\leq{}$mem\_max}.For \IniTeX\ a smaller main memory can suffice, as this program is typicallynot meant to do real typesetting. There may even be a real need for the main memoryto be smaller, because \IniTeX\ needs a lot of auxiliarystorage for initialization and for building thehyphenation table.\point More about formats\spoint Compatibility\TeX\ has a curious error message: `Fatal format error: I'm stymied',which is given if \TeX\ tries to load a format that was madewith an incompatible version of \IniTeX. See the pointabove about memory sizes, and Chapter~\ref[error] forthe hash size (parameters \n{hash\_size} and \n{hash\_prime})and the hyphenation exception dictionary (parameter \n{hyph\_size}).\spoint Preloaded fontsDuring a run of \TeX\ the only information needed about fontsis the data that is found in the \n{tfm} files (see below).Since a run of \TeX, especially if the input contains math material,can easily access 30--40 fonts, the disk access forall the \n{tfm} files can become significant.Therefore the plain format and \LaTeX\ load these metrics files in \IniTeX. A~\TeX\ version using such a formatdoes not need to load any \n{tfm} files.On the other hand, if a format has the possibility of accessinga range of typefaces, it may be advantageous to have metricsfiles loaded on demand during the actual run of \TeX.\spoint The plain formatThe first format written for \TeX, and the basis for alllater ones,is the plain format, described in \TeXbook.It is a mixture of \itemlist\item definitions and macros one simply cannot live withoutsuch as the initial \cs{catcode} assignments, all of the math delimiter definitions,and the \cs{new...} macros;\item constructs that are useful, but for which \LaTeX\ and other packages usea different implementation, such as the tabbing environment; and\item some macros that are insufficient for any but thesimplest applications: \cs{item} and \cs{beginsection}are in this category.\itemliststopIt is the first category which Knuth meant to serve as afoundation for future macro packages, so that theycan live peacefully together (see  Chapter~\ref[alloc]).This idea is reflected in the fact that the name `plain'is not capitalized: it is the basic set of macros.\spoint The \LaTeX\ formatThe \LaTeX\ format\term\LaTeX\par,written by  Leslie Lamport of Digital Equipment Corporationand described in~\cite[LL],was released around 1985.The \LaTeX\ format, using its own versionof \n{plain.tex} (called \n{lplain.tex}),is not compatible with plain \TeX;a~number of plain macros are not available. Still, it containslarge parts of the plain format (even when they overlap withits own constructs).\LaTeX\ is a powerful format with facilities such asmarginal notes, floating objects, cross referencing,and automatic table of contents generation.Its main drawback is that the `style files' whichdefine the actual layout are quite hard to write(although \LaTeX\ is in the process of a major revision,in which this problem will be tackled;see \cite[Frank] and~\cite[Frank2]).As a result,people have had at their disposal mostly the styleswritten by Leslie Lamport, the layout of which israther idiosyncratic. See~\cite[BEP] for a successfulattempt to replace these styles.\spoint Mathematical formatsThere are two formats with extensive facilities formathematics typesetting:\AmsTeX~\cite[Ams](which originated at the American Mathematical Society)and \LamsTeX~\cite[Lams].The first of these includes more facilities than plain \TeX\or \LaTeX\ for typesetting mathematics, but it lacksfeatures such as automatic numbering and cross-referencing,available in \LaTeX, for instance. \LamsTeX, then, is thesynthesis of \AmsTeX\ and \LaTeX. Also it includesstill more features for mathematics, such as complicatedtables and commutative diagrams.\spoint Other formatsOther formats than the above exist:for instance, \n{Phyzzx}~\cite[Phyzzx], \n{TeXsis}~\cite[TeXsis], Macro \TeX~\cite[Amy], \n{eplain}~\cite[Berry],and \n{\TeX T1}~\cite[TeXT1].Typically, such formats provide the facilities of \LaTeX, buttry to be more easily adaptable by the user.Also, in general theyhave been written with the intention of being anadd-on product to the plain format.This book is also written in an `other format':the \n{lollipop} format.\term Lollipop\parThis format does not contain user macros, but thetools with which a style designer can program them; see~\cite[EL].\point The \n{dvi} fileThe \n{dvi} file (this term stands for `device independent')\term \n{dvi} file\parcontains the output of a \TeX\ run: itcontains compactly dumped representations of boxes thathave been sent there by \cs{shipout}\gr{box}. The actof shipping out usually occurs inside the output routine,but this is not necessarily so.\spoint The \n{dvi} file formatA \n{dvi} file is a byte-oriented file,consisting of a preamble, a postamble,and a list of pages.Access for subsequent software to a completed \n{dvi} fileis strictly sequential in nature:the pages are stored as a backwards linked list. Thismeans that only two ways of accessing are possible:\itemlist \item given the start of a page, the next can befound by reading until an end-of-page code is encountered, and\item starting at the end of the file pages can be readbackwards at higher speed, as each beginning-of-page codecontains the byte position of the previous one.\itemliststopThe preamble and postamble contain\itemlist\item the magnification of the document (see below),\item the unit of measurement used for the document, and\item possibly a comment string.\>The postamble contains in addition a list of the font definitionsthat appear on the pages of the file.Neither the preamble nor the postamble of the file contains atable of byte positions of pages.The full definition of the \n{dvi} file format can be foundin~\cite[K:program].\spoint Page identificationWhenever a \cs{shipout} occurs, \TeX\ also writes thevalues of counters  0--9 to the \n{dvi} file and the terminal.Ordinarily, only counter~0, the page number, is used, and theother counters are zero. Those zeros are not output to theterminal. The other counters can be used to indicate furtherstructure in the document. Log output shows the non-zerocounters and the zero counters in between.\spoint Magnification Magnification of a document can be indicated by the \gr{integerparameter} \term magnification\par\csterm mag\par\cs{mag}, which specifies 1000 times the magnificationratio.The \n{dvi} file contains the value of \cs{mag} for thedocument in its preamble and postamble. If no {\tt true} dimensions are usedthe \n{dvi} file will look the same as when no magnificationwould have been used, except for the \cs{mag} value in thepreamble and the postamble.Whenever a {\tt true} dimension is used it is dividedby the value of \cs{mag}, so that the final output will havethe dimension as prescribed by the user.The \cs{mag} parameter cannot be changed after a\n{true} dimension has been used, or after the firstpage has been shipped to the \n{dvi} file.Plain \TeX\ has the \cs{magnification} macro for\csterm magnification\parglobally sizing the document, without changing the physical size of the page:\Ver>\def\magnification{\afterassignment\m@g\count@}\def\m@g{\mag\count@  \hsize6.5truein\vsize8.9truein\dimen\footins8truein}<RevThe explanation for this isas follows: the command \cs{m@g} is saved with an \cs{afterassignment}command, and the magnification value (which is 1000 times theactual magnification factor) is assigned to \cs{count@}.After this assignment, the macro \cs{m@g} assignsthe magnification value to \cs{mag}, and the horizontaland vertical size are reset to their original values {\tt 6.5truein} and {\tt 8.9truein}.The \cs{footins} is also reset.\point[special] Specials\TeX\ is to a large degree machine"-independent, but it still needs\term specials\par\csterm special\para hook for machine-dependent extensions. This is the\cs{special} command, which writes a \gr{balanced text}to the \n{dvi} file. \TeX\ does not interpret this token list:it assumes that the printer driver knows what to do with it.\cs{special} commands are supposed not to change the$x$ and $y$ position on the page, so that the implementationof \TeX\ remains independent of the actual device driver\term device drivers\parthat handles the \cs{special}.The most popular application of specials is probably theinclusion of graphic material, written in somepage description language, such as PostScript\term PostScript\par.The size of the graphics can usually be determined fromthe file containing it (in the case of encapsulatedPostScript throughthe `bounding box' data), so \TeX\ can leave space forsuch material.\point Time\TeX\ has four parameters, \cs{year}, \cs{month}, \cs{day}, and\cs{time}, that tell\csterm year\par\csterm month\par\csterm day\par\csterm time\par\term time\par\term date\parthe time when the current job started.After this, the parameters are not updated.The user can change them at any time.All four parameters are integers; the \cs{time} parametergives the number of minutes since midnight that the currentjob started.\point FontsFont information is split in the \TeX\ system intothe metric information (how high, wide, and deep is a character),and the actual description of the characters in a font.\TeX, the formatter, needs only the metric information;printer drivers and screen previewers need the characterdescriptions. With this approach it is for instance possiblefor \TeX\ to use with relative ease the resident fonts ofa printer.\spoint Font metricsThe metric information of \TeX's fonts is stored in \n{tfm}\term font metrics\parfiles, which stands for `\TeX\ font metric' files.Metrics files contain the following information(see \cite[K:program] for the full definition):\itemlist\item the design size of a font;\item the values for the \cs{fontdimen} parameters(see Chapter~\ref[font]);\item the height, depth, width, and italic correction     of individual characters;\item kerning tables;\item ligature tables;\item information regarding successors and extensionsof math characters (see Chapter~\ref[mathchar]).\itemliststopMetrics files use a packed format, but they can be convertedto and from a readable format by the auxiliary programs\n{tftopl} and \n{pltotf} (see~\cite[K:Fuchs]). Here \n{pl} stands for `property list',a term deriving from the programming language Lisp.Files in \n{pl} format are just text, so they can easily be edited;after conversionthey can then again be used as \n{tfm} files.\spoint[virtual:fonts] Virtual fontsWith `virtual fonts' (see~\cite[K:virt]) it is possible that\term virtual fonts\parwhat looks like one font to \TeX\ resides in more thanone physical font file. Also, virtual fonts can be usedto change in effect the internal organization of font files.For  \TeX\ itself, thepresence of virtual fonts makes no difference: everythingis still based on \n{tfm} files containing metricinformation. However, the screen or printer driver that displaysthe resulting \n{dvi} file on the screen or on a printerwill search for files with extension \n{.vf} to determinehow characters are to be interpreted.The \n{vf} file can, for instance, instruct the driverto interpret a character as a certain positionin a certain font file, to interpret a character as morethan one position (a~way of forming accented characters),or to include \cs{special} information (forinstance to set gray levels).Readable variants of \n{vf} files have extension \n{vpl},analogous to the \n{pl} files for the \n{tfm} files; see above.Conversion between \n{vf} and \n{vpl} files can beperformed with the \n{vftovp} and \n{vptovf} programs.However, because virtual fonts are a matter for\term device drivers\pardevice drivers, no more details will be given in this book.\spoint Font filesCharacter descriptions are stored in three types of files.\term font files\par\description \item gf    Generic Font files.This is the file type that the Metafont program generates.There are not many previewers or printer drivers that usethis type of file directly.\item pxl    Pixel files. The \n{pxl} format is a pure bitmap format.Thus it is easy to generate \n{pxl} files from, for instance,scanner images.This format should be superseded by the \n{pk} format.Pixel files can become rather big,as their size grows quadratically in the size of the characters.\item pk    Packed files. Pixel files can be packed by a form of run-lengthencoding: instead of storing the complete bitmap only thestarting positions and lengths of `runs' of black and whitepixels are stored. This makes the size of \n{pk} filesapproximately linear in the size of the characters.However, a previewer or printer driver using a packed font filehas to unpack it before it is   able to use it.\descriptionstopThe following conversion programs exist:\n{gftopxl}, \n{gftopk}, \n{pktopxl}, \n{pxltopk}.\spoint Computer ModernThe only family of typefaces that comes with \TeX\ in the standard distribution is the `Computer\term Computer Modern typefaces\parModern' family. This is an adaptation (using the terminologyof~\cite[S]) by Donald Knuth of the Monotype Modern~8A typefacethat was used for the first volume of his {\italic Art of ComputerProgramming\/} series. The `modern faces' all derive from thetypes that were cut between 1780 and 1800 by Firmin Didot inFrance, Giambattista Bodoni in Italy, and Justus Erich Walbaumin Germany. After the first two, these types are also called`Didone' types. This name was coined in the Vox classificationof types \cite[Vox]. Ultimately, the inspiration for the Didonetypes is the `Romain du Roi', the type that was designed byNicolas Jaugeon around 1692 for the French Imprimerie Royale.Didone types are characterized by a strong vertical orientation,and thin hairlines. The vertical accent is strengthened by thefact that the insides of curves are flattened.The result is a clear and brilliant page, provided that theprinting is done carefully and on good quality paper.\message{Reference format}However, they are quite vulnerable; \cite[Up]compares them to the distinguished but fragile furniturefrom the same period, saying one is afraid to use either,`for both seem in danger of breaking in pieces'.With the current proliferation of low resolution (around300 dot per inch) printers, the Computer Modern isa somewhat unfortunate choice.Recently, Donald Knuth has developed a new typeface (or rather, a subfamily of typefaces)by changing parametersin the Computer Modern family. The result is a so-called`Egyptian' typeface: Computer Concrete \cite[K:cc].The name derives from thefact that it was intended primarily for the book {\italic ConcreteMathematics}. Egyptian typefaces (they fall under the `M\'ecanes'in the Vox classification, meaning constructed,not derived from written letters) have a very uniform line widthand square serifs. They do not have anything to do with Egypt;such types happened to be popular in the first half of the nineteenthcentury when Egyptology was developing and popular.\point \TeX\ and webThe \TeX\ program is written in \web, a programming language\term \web\par\term Pascal\parthat can be considered as a subset of Pascal, augmented witha preprocessor.\TeX\ makes no use of some features of Pascal, in order tofacilitate porting to Pascal systems other than the oneit was originally designed for, and even to enable automatictranslation to other programming languages such as~C.For instance, it does not use the Pascal \n{With} construct.Also, procedures do not have output parameters; apart fromwriting to global variables, the only wayvalues are returned is through\n{Function} values.Actually, \web\ is more than a superset of a subset of Pascal(and to be more precise, it can also be used with otherprogramming languages);it is a `system of structured documentation'. This means thatthe \web\ programmer writes pieces of program code,interspersed with their documentation, in one file. This idea of `literate programming' wasintroduced  in~\cite[K:literate];for more information, see~\cite[Sewell].Two auxiliary programs,Tangle and Weave, can then be used to strip the documentationand convert \web\ into regular Pascal, or to convert the\web\ file into a \TeX\ file that will typeset the program and documentation.Portability of \web\ programs is achieved by the `change file'mechanism. A~change file is a list of changes to be made tothe \web\ file; a~bit like a stream editor script.These changes can comprise both adaptations of the \web\ fileto the particular Pascal compiler that will be used, andbug fixes to \TeX. Thus the \n{TeX.web} file need never be edited.\point The \TeX\ Users Group\TeX\ users have joined into several users groups\term TUG\parover the last decade. Many national or languageusers groups exist, and a lot of them publish newsletters.The oldest of all \TeX\ users groups is simply calledthat: the \TeX\ Users Group, or TUG,and its journal is called {\italic TUGboat}\term TUGboat\par.You can reach them at\disp \TeX\ Users Group\nl P.O. Box 869\nl     Santa Barbara, CA 93102, USA\> or electronically at \n{tug@math.ams.org} on the Internet.\endinput
