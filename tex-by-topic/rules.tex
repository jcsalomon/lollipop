\subject[rules]  Rules and LeadersRules and leaders are two ways of getting \TeX\ to draw a line.Leaders are more general than rules: they can also fillavailable space with copies of a certain box. This chapterexplain how rules and leaders work, and how they interact with modes.\invent\item hrule       Rule that spreads in horizontal direction.\item vrule       Rule that spreads in vertical direction.\item leaders       Fill a specified amount of space with a rule or copies of box.\item cleaders       Like \ver=\leaders=, but with box leaders       any excess space is split equally before and after the leaders.\item xleaders       Like \ver=\leaders=, but with box leaders any excess space is       spread equally before, after, and between the boxes.\inventstop\point Rules\TeX's rule commands give\term rules\parrectangular black patches with horizontal and vertical sides.Most of the times, a rule command will give output thatlooks like a rule, but~\hbox{\vrule height 1.5ex width 1.5ex}can also be produced by a rule.\TeX\ has both horizontal and vertical rules, but the names do not necessarily imply anything about the shape.\csterm hrule\par\csterm vrule\parThey do, however, imply something about modes:an \cs{hrule} command can only be used in vertical mode,and a \cs{vrule} only in horizontal mode.In fact, an \cs{hrule} is a \gr{vertical command}, and a \cs{vrule}is a \gr{horizontal command}, so \TeX\ may changemodes when encountering these commands.Why then is a \cs{vrule} called a {\em vertical\/} rule?The reason is that a \cs{vrule} can expand arbitrarilyfar in the vertical direction: if its height and depth are notspecified explicitly it will take as much room as itssurroundings allow\altt.\example \Ver>\hbox{\vrule\ text \vrule}<Revlooks like \disp\leavevmode\hbox{\vrule\ text \vrule}\dispstopand \Ver>\hbox{\vrule\ A gogo! \vrule}<Rev looks like\disp\leavevmode\hbox{\vrule\ A gogo! \vrule}\dispstop\>For the \cs{hrule} command a similar statement is true:a horizontal rule can spread to assume the width ofits surroundings. Thus \Ver>\vbox{\hbox{One line of text}\hrule}<Rev looks like\disp\leavevmode\vtop{\hbox{One line of text}\hrule}\dispstop\spoint Rule dimensionsHorizontal and vertical rules have a default thickness:\Disp \cs{hrule}\quad is the same as\quad \ver-\hrule height.4pt depth0pt-\Dispstopand \Disp \cs{vrule}\quad is the same as\quad \ver-\vrule width.4pt- \Dispstopand if the remaining dimension remains unspecified, the ruleextends in that direction to fill the enclosing box.Here is the formal specification of how to indicate rule sizes:\disp\gr{vertical rule} $\longrightarrow$                         \cs{vrule}\gr{rule specification}\nl     \gr{horizontal rule} $\longrightarrow$                        \cs{hrule}\gr{rule specification}\nl     \gr{rule specification} $\longrightarrow$                        \gr{optional spaces} \nl \indent$|$                        \gr{rule dimensions}\gr{rule specification}\nl     \gr{rule dimension} $\longrightarrow$                        \n{width}\gr{dimen} $|$ \n{height}\gr{dimen} $|$                        \n{depth}\gr{dimen}     \dispstopIf a rule dimension is specified twice, the second instancetakes precedence over the first. This makes it possibleto override the default dimensions. For instance,after\alt\howto Change the default dimensions of rules\par\Ver>\let\xhrule\hrule  \def\hrule{\xhrule height .8pt}<Revthe macro \cs{hrule} gives a horizontal ruleof double the original height, and it is still possiblewith \Ver>\hrule height 2pt<Revto specify other heights.It is possible to specify all three dimensions; then\Ver>\vrule height1ex depth0pt width1ex<Rev and\Ver>\hrule height1ex depth0pt width1ex<Rev look the same.Still, each of them can be used only in the appropriate mode.\point LeadersRules are intimately connected to modes, which makes it easy\term leaders\parto obtain some effects. For instance, a typical applicationof a vertical rule looks like\Ver>\hbox{\vrule width1pt\ Important text! \vrule width 1pt}<Revwhich gives\disp\leavevmode\hbox{\vrule width 1pt\ Important text!                       \vrule width 1pt}\>However, one might want to have a horizontal rulein horizontal mode for effects such as\disp\leavevmode\vbox{\hbox to 5cm{$\longleftarrow$\hfil 5cm\hfil$\longrightarrow$}    \hbox to 5cm{from here\leaders\hrule\hfil to there}}\dispstopAn \cs{hrule} can not be used in horizontal mode, anda vertical rule will not spread automatically.However, there is a way to use an \cs{hrule} command inhorizontal mode and a \cs{vrule} in vertical mode,and that is with `leaders', so called becausethey lead your eye across the page. A~leader command tells \TeX\to fill a~specified space, in whatever mode it is in,with as many copies of some box or rule specificationas are needed. For instance, the above examplewas given as\disp\ver>\hbox to 5cm{from here\leaders\hrule\hfil to there}>\dispstopthat is, with an \cs{hrule} that was allowed to stretch alongan \cs{hfil}.Note that the leader was given a horizontal skip,corresponding to the horizontal mode in which it appeared.A general leader command looks like\Disp \gr{leaders}\gr{box or rule}%      \gr{vertical/horizontal/mathematical skip}\Dispstopwhere \gr{leaders} is \cs{leaders}, \cs{cleaders}, or~\cs{xleaders}, a \gr{box~or~rule}is a~\gr{box}, \cs{vrule}, or~\cs{hrule}, and thelists of horizontal and vertical skips appear in Chapter~\ref[hvmode];a~mathematical skip is either a horizontal skip or an~\cs{mskip}(see page~\pgref[muglue]).Leaders can thus be used in all three modes. Of course, theappropriate kind of skip must be specified. A horizontal (vertical) box containing leaders has at leastthe height and depth (width) of the \gr{box~or~rule} usedin the leaders, even if, as can happen in the case of box leaders,no actual leaders are placed.\spoint Rule leadersRule leaders fill the specified amount of space with a rule\term rule leaders\par\csterm leaders\parextending in the direction of the skip specified.The other dimensions of the resulting rule leaderare determined by the sort of rule that is used:either dimensions can be specified explicitly, orthe default values can be used.For instance, \Ver>\hbox{g\leaders\hrule\hskip20pt f}<Revgives \disp\leavevmode\hbox{g\leaders\hrule\hskip20pt f}\dispstopbecause a horizontal rule has a default height of~\n{.4pt}.On the other hand,\Ver>\hbox{g\leaders\vrule\hskip20pt f}<Revgives \disp\leavevmode\hbox{g\leaders\vrule\hskip20pt f}\dispstopbecause the height and depth of a vertical ruleby default fill the surrounding box.Spurious rule dimensions are ignored: in horizontal mode\Ver>\leaders\hrule width 10pt \hskip 20pt<Revis equivalent to\Ver>\leaders\hrule \hskip 20pt<RevIf the width or height-plus-depthof either the skip or the box is negative, \TeX\ uses ordinary glue instead of leaders.\spoint Box leadersBox leaders fill the available spaces with copies ofa given box, instead of with a rule. \newbox\centerdot  \setbox\centerdot=\hbox{\hskip.7em.\hskip.7em}For all of the following examples, assume that a box registerhas been allocated:\Ver>\newbox\centerdot  \setbox\centerdot=\hbox{\hskip.7em.\hskip.7em}<RevNow the output of\Ver>\hbox to 8cm {here\leaders\copy\centerdot\hfil there}<Revis \disp\leavevmode\hbox to 8cm {here\leaders\copy\centerdot\hfil there}\dispstop That is, copies of the box register fill up theavailable space.Dot leaders, as in the above example, are often used fortables of contents. In such applications it is desirable thatdots on subsequent lines are vertically aligned.The \cs{leaders} command does this automatically:\Ver>\hbox to 8cm {here\leaders\copy\centerdot\hfil there}\hbox to 8cm {over here\leaders\copy\centerdot\hfil over there}<Revgives \disp\leavevmode\vtop{\hbox to 8cm {here\leaders\copy\centerdot\hfil there}\hbox to 8cm {over here\leaders\copy\centerdot\hfil over there\strut}}\dispstopThe mechanism behind this is the following:\TeX\ acts as if an infinite row of boxes starts (invisibly) at the left edge of the surrounding box, and the row of copies actually placed is merely the part of this row that is not obscured bythe other contents of the box.Stated differently, box leaders are a window on an infiniterow of boxes, and the row starts at the left edge of thesurrounding box. Consider the following example:\Ver>\hbox to 8cm {\leaders\copy\centerdot\hfil}\hbox to 8cm {word\leaders\copy\centerdot\hfil}<Revwhich gives\disp\leavevmode\vtop{\hbox to 8cm {\leaders\copy\centerdot\hfil}\hbox to 8cm {word\leaders\copy\centerdot\hfil\strut}}\dispstopThe row of leaders boxes becomes visible as soon as itdoes not coincide with other material.The above discussion only talked about leaders in horizontalmode. Leaders can equally well be placed in vertical mode;for box leaders the `infinite row' then starts at the topof the surrounding box.\spoint Evenly spaced leadersAligning subsequent box leaders in the way described abovemeans that the white space before and after theleaders will in general be different.If vertical alignment is notan issue it may be aesthetically more pleasing to havethe leaders evenly spaced.The \cs{cleaders} command is like \cs{leaders},\csterm cleaders\parexcept that it splits excess space before and after the leadersinto two equal parts, centring the row of boxes in theavailable space.\example\message{check verbatim indentation}\Ver>\hbox to 7.8cm {here\cleaders\copy\centerdot\hfil there}\hbox to 7.8cm {here is\cleaders\copy\centerdot\hfil there}<Revgives \disp\leavevmode\vbox{\hbox to 7.8cm {here\cleaders\copy\centerdot\hfil there}\hbox to 7.8cm {here is\cleaders\copy\centerdot\hfil there\strut}}\dispstopThe `expanding leaders' \cs{xleaders} spread excess space evenly\csterm xleaders\parbetween the boxes, with equal globs of glue before, after,and in between leader boxes.\>\example \Ver>\hbox to 7.8cm{here\hskip.7em      \xleaders\copy\centerdot\hfil  \hskip.7em there}<Revgives \disp\leavevmode\hbox to 7.8cm {here\hskip.7em\xleaders\copy\centerdot\hfil\hskip.7em there}\dispstop Note that the glue in the leader box is balanced herewith explicit glue before and after the leaders;leaving out these glue items, as in\Ver>\hbox to 7.8cm {here\xleaders\copy\centerdot\hfil there}<Revgives \disp\leavevmode\hbox to 7.8cm {here\xleaders\copy\centerdot\hfil there}\dispstopwhich is clearly not what was intended.\>\point Assorted remarks\spoint Rules and modesAbove it was explained how rules can only occur in the appropriate modes. Rules also influence mode-specificquantities:no baselineskip is added before rules in vertical mode. In order to prevent glue after rules,\TeX\ sets \cs{prevdepth} to\n{\hbox{-}1000pt}(see Chapter~\ref[baseline]).Similarly the \cs{spacefactor} is set to 1000 after a \cs{vrule}in horizontal mode (see Chapter~\ref[line:break]).\spoint[par:leaders:end] Ending a paragraph with leadersAn attempt to simulate an \cs{hrule} at the end of a paragraph by\howto End a paragraph with leaders\par\Ver>\nobreak\leaders\hrule\hfill\par<Revdoes not work. The reason for this is that \TeX\performs an \cs{unskip} at the end of a paragraph,which removes the leaders. Normally this \cs{unskip} removesany space token inserted by the input processor after thelast line. Remedy: stick an \ver.\hbox{}. at the end ofthe leaders.\spoint Leaders and box registersIn the above examples the leader box was inserted with\cs{copy}. The output of\Ver>\hbox to 8cm {here\leaders\box\centerdot\hfil there}\hbox to 8cm {over here\leaders\box\centerdot\hfil                    over there}<Revis\disp\leavevmode     \vtop{\hbox to 8cm {here\leaders\box\centerdot\hfil there}           \hbox to 8cm {over here\leaders\box\centerdot\hfil over there}           }\dispstopThe box register is emptied after the first leader command,but more than one copy is placed in that first command.\spoint Output in leader boxesAny \cs{write}, \cs{openout}, or \cs{closeout} operationappearing in leader boxes is ignored. Otherwise such an operation would be executed once for everycopy of the box that would be shipped out.\spoint Box leaders in trace outputThe dumped box representation obtained from,for instance, \cs{tracingoutput}does not write out box leaders in full: only the total size andone copy of the box used are dumped. In particular,the surrounding white space before and after the leadersis not indicated.\spoint Leaders and shifted marginsIf margins have been shifted,leaders may look differentdepending on how the shift has been realized.For an illustration of how \cs{hangindent} and \cs{leftskip}influence the look of leaders, consider the followingexamples, where\Ver>\setbox0=\hbox{K o }<RevThe horizontal boxes above  the leaders\alttserve to indicate the starting point of the row of leaders.First\Ver>\hbox{\leaders\copy0\hskip5cm}\noindent\advance\leftskip 1em      \leaders\copy0\hskip5cm\hbox{}\par<Revgives\message{examples on}\disp\leavevmode\vbox{\leftskip=0pt \hsize=7cm\setbox0=\hbox{K o }\hbox{\leaders\copy0\hskip5cm}\noindent\advance\leftskip 1em      \leaders\copy0\hskip5cm\hbox{}\par    }\>Then\Ver>\hbox{\kern1em\hbox{\leaders\copy0\hskip5cm}}\hangindent=1em \hangafter=-1 \noindent      \leaders\copy0\hskip5cm\hbox{}\par<Revgives (note the shift with respect to the previous example)\disp\leavevmode\vbox{\leftskip=0pt \hsize=7cm\setbox0=\hbox{K o }\hbox{\kern1em\hbox{\leaders\copy0\hskip5cm}}\hangindent=1em \hangafter=-1 \noindent      \leaders\copy0\hskip5cm\hbox{}\par}\dispstop\message{one page}In the first paragraph the \cs{leftskip} glue only obscuresthe first leader box; in the second paragraph the hangingindentation actually shifts the orientation point for the row of leaders. Hanging indentation is performed in \TeX\by a \cs{moveright} of the boxes containing the linesof the paragraph.\endinput
