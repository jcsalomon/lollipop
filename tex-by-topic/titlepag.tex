Their commentshelped to improve the presentation.Also I~would like to thank the participants ofthe discussion lists \TeX hax, \TeX-nl, and {\tt comp.text.tex}.Their questions and answers gave me much food for thought.Finally, any acknowledgement in a book about \TeX\ ought toinclude Donald Knuth for inventing \TeX\ in thefirst place. This book is no exception.\hfil\break\hbox{}\hfill \Style:italic Victor Eijkhout\break\hbox{}\hfill Urbana, Illinois, August 1991\par\vfil\eject%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% vii  table of contents\parskip=0pt \PointSize:10 \Style:roman\HasNum:no\asubject Contents\LoadExternalFile:contents\eject%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% trademarks\emptypage\hbox{}\vfill{\bold Trademark notice}\nlIBM\TM\ is a trademark of International Business Machines Corporation.\nlMetafont\TM\ is a trademark of Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.\nlPostScript\TM\ is a trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated.\nl\TeX\TM\ and \AmsTeX\TM\ are     trademarks of the American Mathematical Society.\nlUNIX\TM\ is a trademark of AT\&T.%\eject\endinput
