\subject[group] Grouping\TeX\ has a grouping mechanism that is able to confine mostchanges to a~particular locality. This chapter explainswhat sort of actions can be local, and how groups are formed.\invent\item bgroup Implicit beginning of group character.\item egroup Implicit end of group character.\item begingroup Open a group that must be closed with \cs{endgroup}.\item endgroup Close a group that was opened with \cs{begingroup}.\item aftergroup Save the next token for insertion after the current group ends.\item global Make assignments, macro definitions, and arithmetic global.\item globaldefs Parameter for overriding \cs{global} prefixes.\IniTeX\ default:~0.\inventstop\point The grouping mechanismA group is a sequence of tokens starting with a\term grouping\par`beginning of group' token,and ending with an `end of group'token, and in which all such tokens are properly balanced. The grouping mechanism of \TeX\ is not the same asthe block structureof ordinary programming languages.Most languages with block structure are only able  to havelocal definitions. \TeX's grouping mechanism is stronger: most assignments made inside a groupare local to that group unless explicitly indicated otherwise,and outside the group old values are restored.An example of local definitions\Ver>{\def\a{b}}\a<Rev gives an `undefined control sequence'message because \cs{a} is only defined inside the group.Similarly, the code\Ver>\count0=1 {\count0=2 } \showthe\count0<Revwill display the value~1; the assignment made inside the groupis undone at the end of the group.Bookkeeping of values that are to be restored outside the groupis done through the mechanism\term save stack\parof the `save stack'. Overflow of the save stack is treatedin Chapter~\ref[error]. The save stack is also used fora few other purposes: in calls such as \hbox{\ver>\hbox to 100pt{...}>}the specification \hbox{\n{to 100pt}} is put on the savestack before a new level of grouping is opened.In order to prevent a lot of trouble with the save stack,\IniTeX\ does not allow dumping a format inside a group.The \cs{end} command is allowed to occur inside a group,but \TeX\ will give a diagnostic message about this.The \cs{aftergroup} control sequence saves a token forinsertion after the current group. Several tokens can beset aside by this command, and they are inserted in the left-to-rightorder in which they were stated.This is treated in Chapter~\ref[expand].\point[global:assign] Local and global assignmentsAn assignment or macro definitionis usually made global by prefixing it with \cs{global},\term local statements\par\term global statements\par\csterm global\par\csterm globaldefs\parbut non-zero values of the \gr{integer parameter}\cs{globaldefs} override \cs{global}specifications: if \cs{globaldefs} is positive every assignmentis implicitly prefixed with \cs{global}, and if\cs{globaldefs} is negative, \cs{global} isignored. Ordinarily this parameter is zero.Some assignment are always global: the \gr{global assignment}s are\description\FlushRight:no\item \gr{font assignment}assignments involving \cs{fontdimen}, \cs{hyphenchar}, and \cs{skew\-char}.\item \gr{hyphenation assignment}\cs{hyphenation} and \cs{patterns} commands(see Chapter~\ref[line:break]).\item \gr{box size assignment}altering box dimensions with \cs{ht}, \cs{dp}, and~\cs{wd}(see Chapter~\ref[boxes]).\item \gr{interaction mode assignment}run modes for a \TeX\ job (see Chapter~\ref[run]).\item \gr{intimate assignment}assignments to a \gr{special integer} or \gr{special dimen};see %Chapters \ref[number] and~\ref[glue].pages \pgref[special:int:list] and~\pgref[special:dimen:list].\descriptionstop\point Group delimitersA group can be delimited by character tokens of category code~1 \term delimiter, group~--\parfor `beginning of group' and code~2 for `end of  group', orcontrol sequence tokens that are \cs{let} to such characters,the \cs{bgroup} and \cs{egroup} in plain \TeX.Implicit and explicit braces can match to delimita group.Groups can also be delimited by \cs{begingroup} and\cs{endgroup}. These two control sequences must\csterm begingroup\par\csterm endgroup\parbe used together: they cannot be matched with implicitor explicit braces, nor can they function as the bracessurrounding, for instance, boxed material.Delimiting with \cs{begingroup} and \cs{endgroup} can\label[begin:end:macros]%provide a limited form of run-time error checking. In between these two group delimiters an excessopen or close brace would result in\Ver>\begingroup ... } ... \endgroup<Rev or\Ver>\begingroup ... { ... \endgroup<RevIn both cases \TeX\ gives an error message about improperbalancing. Using \cs{bgroup} and \cs{egroup} here wouldmake an error much harder to find, because of the incorrectmatching that would occur. This idea is used in the environmentmacros of several formats.The choice of the brace characters for the beginning and end of groupcharacters is not hard-wired in \TeX. It is arranged\csterm bgroup\par\csterm egroup\parlike this in the plain format:\Ver>\catcode`\{=1 % left brace is begin-group character\catcode`\}=2 % right brace is end-group character<RevImplicit braces have also been defined in the plain format:\Ver>\let\bgroup={ \let\egroup=}<RevSpecial cases are the following:\itemlist \item The replacement text of a macro must be enclosedin  explicit beginning and end of group character tokens.\item  The open and close braces for boxes, \cs{vadjust},and \cs{insert} can be implicit. This makes it possibleto define, for instance\Ver>\def\openbox#1{\setbox#1=\hbox\bgroup}\def\closebox#1{\egroup\box#1}\openbox{15}Foo bar\closebox{15}<Rev\item The right-hand side of a token list assignment and theargument of the commands \cs{write}, \cs{message}, \cs{errmessage}, \cs{uppercase}, \cs{lowercase}, \cs{special}, and \cs{mark} is a \gr{general text}, definedas\Disp \gr{general text} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{filler}\lb      \gr{balanced text}\gr{right brace}\Dispstopmeaning that the left brace can be implicit, but the closingright brace must be an explicit character token with categorycode~2. \itemliststopIn cases where an implicit left brace suffices, and whereexpansion is not explicitly inhibited, \TeX\ willexpand tokens until a left brace is encountered. Thisis the basis for such constructs as\ver=\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral80}=,which in this unexpanded form do not adhere to thesyntax. If the first unexpandable token is not a leftbrace \TeX\ gives an error message.The grammar of \TeX\ (see Chapter~\ref[gramm])  uses\gr{left brace} and \gr{right brace} for explicitcharacters, that is, character tokens,and \n{\lb} and~\n{\rb} for possibly implicit characters,\alttthat is, control sequences that have been \cs{let} to suchexplicit characters.\point More about braces\spoint Brace counters\TeX\ has two counters for keeping  track of grouping levels:\term braces\parthe {\it master counter} and the {\it balance counter}.Both of these counters are syntactic counters: they count theexplicit brace character tokens, but are not affected by implicitbraces (such as \cs{bgroup}) that are semantically equivalentto an explicit brace.The balance counter handles braces in all cases except inalignment. Its workings are intuitively clear: it goes upby one for every opening and down for every closingbrace that is not being skipped. Thus\Ver>\iffalse{\fi<Rev increases the balance counter ifthis statement is merely scanned (for instance if itappears in a macro definition text); if this statementis executed the brace is skipped, so there is no effect onthe balance counter.The master counter is more tricky;it is used in alignments instead of the balance counter.This counter records all braces, even when they are skippedsuch as in \ver>\iffalse{\fi>.For this counter uncounted skipped braces are still possible:the alphabetic constants \n{`\lb} and \n{`\rb} haveno effect on this counter when they areuse by the execution processor as a~\gr{number};they do affect this counter when they are seen by the input processor (which merely sees characters, and notthe context).\spoint The brace as a tokenExplicit braces are character tokens, and as such they areunexpandable. This implies that they survive until thelast stages of \TeX\ processing. For example,\Ver>\count255=1{2}<Rev will assign~1 to \cs{count255},and print~`2', because theopening brace functions as a delimiter for the number~1.Similarly \Ver>f{f}<Rev will prevent \TeX\ from formingan `\hbox{ff}' ligature.From the fact that braces are unexpandable,it follows that their nesting is independentof the nesting of conditionals. For instance\Ver>\iftrue{\else}\fi<Rev will give an open brace,as conditionals are handled by expansion. The closingbrace is simply skipped as part of the \gr{false text};any consequences it has for grouping only come intoplay in a later stage of \TeX\ processing.Undelimited macro arguments are either single tokensor groups of tokens enclosed in explicit braces.Thus it is not possible for an explicit open or close braceto be a macro argument. However, braces can be assignedwith \cs{let}, for instance as in \Ver>\let\bgroup={<RevThis is used in the plain \cs{footnote} macro(see page~\pgref[footnote:ex]).\spoint \csc{\char 123} and \csc{\char 125}The control sequences \ver-\{- and \ver-\}- do not really belong\csterm\char123\par\csterm\char125\parin this chapter,  not being concerned with grouping.They have been defined with \cs{let} as synonyms of\cs{lbrace} and \cs{rbrace} respectively,and these control sequences are \cs{delimiter} instructions(see Chapter~\ref[mathchar]).The Computer Modern Roman font has no braces, but there arebraces in the typewriter font, and for mathematics there are braces of different sizes \ldash and extendable ones \rdash inthe extension font.\endinput
