\subject[mathchar] Characters in Math ModeIn math mode every character specifies by its\cs{mathcode} what position ofa font to access, among other things.For delimiters this story is a bitmore complicated. This chapter explains the conceptof math codes, and shows how \TeX\ implements variablesize delimiters. \invent\item mathcode       Code of a character determining its treatment in math mode.\item mathchar       Explicit denotation of a mathematical character.\item mathchardef       Define a control sequence to be a synonym for      a~math character code.\item delcode       Code specifying how a character should be used as delimiter.\item delimiter       Explicit denotation of a delimiter.\item delimiterfactor       1000 times the fraction of a delimited formula that should be      covered by a delimiter.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{901}\item delimitershortfall       Size of the part of a delimited formula that is allowed       to go uncovered by a delimiter.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{5pt}\item nulldelimiterspace       Width taken for empty delimiters.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{1.2pt}\item left       Use the following character as an open delimiter.\item right       Use the following character as a closing delimiter.\item big       One line high delimiter.\item Big       One and a half line high delimiter.\item bigg       Two lines high delimiter.\item Bigg       Two and a half lines high delimiter.\item bigl {\MainFont etc.}      Left delimiters.\item bigm {\MainFont etc.}      Delimiters used as binary relations.\item bigr {\MainFont etc.}      Right delimiters.\item radical       Command for setting things such as root signs.\item mathaccent       Place an accent in math mode.\item skewchar       Font position of an after-placed accent.\item defaultskewchar       Value of \cs{skewchar} when a font is loaded.\item skew       Macro to shift accents on top of characters explicitly.\item widehat      Hat accent that can      accommodate wide expressions.\item widetilde      Tilde accent that can      accommodate wide expressions.\inventstop\point Mathematical charactersEach of the 256 permissible character codes has\term math characters\par\csterm mathcode\paran associated \cs{mathcode}, which can be assigned by\disp\cs{mathcode}\gr{8-bit number}\gr{equals}\gr{15-bit number}\dispstopWhen processing in math mode, \TeX\ replaces all characters ofcategories 11 and~12, and \cs{char} and \cs{chardef} characters,by their associated mathcode.The  15-bit math code is most conveniently denoted hexadecimallyas \ver-"xyzz-, where\disp\n x${}\leq7$ is the class (see page~\pgref[math:class]),\nl\n y is the font family number \alt(see Chapter~\ref[mathfont]), and \nl\n{zz} is the position of the character in the font.\dispstopMath codes can also be specified directly by \csterm mathchar\par\csterm mathchardef\para \gr{math character}, which can be\label[math:character]\itemlist\item\cs{mathchar}\gr{15-bit number}; \item \gr{mathchardef token}, a control sequence that was defined by\disp\cs{mathchardef}\gr{control sequence}\gr{equals}\gr{15-bit number}\> or\item a delimiter command\alt\disp\cs{delimiter}\gr{27-bit number}\> where the last 12 bitsare discarded.\itemliststopThe commands \cs{mathchar} and \cs{mathchardef}are analogous to \cs{char} and \cs{char\-def} in text mode.Delimiters are treated below.A~\gr{mathchardef token} can be used as a \gr{number}, even outside math mode.In \IniTeX\ all letters receive \cs{mathcode} \ver-"71zz- andall digits receive \ver-"70zz-, where \ver-"zz- is the hexadecimal position of the character in the font.Thus, letters are initially from family~1(math italic in plain \TeX), and digits are from family~0(roman).For all other characters, \IniTeX\ assigns\disp\cs{mathcode}$\,x=x$,\dispstopthereby placing them also in family~0.If the mathcode is \ver-"8000-,\label[mcode:8000]the smallest integer that isnot a \gr{15-bit number}, the character is treated as an activecharacter with the original character code. Plain \TeX\assigns a \cs{mathcode} of \ver-"8000- to the space, underscore and prime.\point DelimitersAfter \cs{left} and \cs{right}\term delimiters\par\csterm left\par\csterm right\parcommands \TeX\ looks for a delimiter. A~delimiteris either an explicit \cs{delimiter} command (or amacro abbreviation for it), or a character with a non-zerodelimiter code.The \cs{left} and \cs{right} commandsimplicitly delimit a group, which is considered as a subformula.Since the enclosed formula canbe arbitrarily large, the quest for the proper delimiter isa complicated story of looking at variants in two differentfonts, linked chains of variants in a font, and buildingextendable delimiters from repeatable pieces.The fact that a group enclosed in \ver>\left...\right> istreated as an independent subformula implies that asub- or superscript at the start of this formula isnot considered to belong to the delimiter. For example, \TeX\ acts as if \ver>\left(_2> is equivalent to \ver>\left({}_2>.(A~subscript after a \cs{right} delimiter is positionedwith respect to that delimiter.)\spoint[delcodes] Delimiter codes To each character code there corresponds a delimiter\csterm delcode\par\term delimiter codes\parcode, assigned by\disp\cs{delcode}\gr{8-bit number}\gr{equals}%          \gr{24-bit number}\dispstopA delimiter code thus consists of six hexadecimal digits\ver-"uvvxyy-, where\disp\n{uvv} is the small variant of the delimiter, and\nl\n{xyy} is the large variant;\nl\n u, \n x are the font families of the variants, and\nl\n{vv}, \n{yy} are the locations in those fonts.\dispstopDelimiter codes are used after \cs{left} and \cs{right}commands.\IniTeX\ sets all delimiter codes to~$-1$,except\label[ini:del]\ver-\delcode`.=0-, which makes the period an empty delimiter.In plain \TeX\ delimiters have typically \n{u}${}=2$ and~\n{x}${}=3$,that is, first family~2 is tried, and if no bigenough delimiter turns up family~3 is tried.\spoint Explicit \cs{delimiter} commandsDelimiters can also be denoted \csterm delimiter\parexplicitly by a \gr{27-bit number},\Ver>\delimiter"tuvvxyy<Revwhere \n{uvvxyy} are the small and large variant of thedelimiter as above;the extra digit \n{t} (which is~$<8$) denotes the class(see page~\pgref[math:class]).For instance, the \cs{langle} macro is defined as\Ver>\def\langle{\delimiter "426830A }<Revwhich means it belongs to class~4, opening. Similarly,\cs{rangle} is of class~5, closing; and \cs{uparrow} is of class~3,relation.After \cs{left} and \cs{right} \ldash that is, when \TeX\is looking for a delimiter \rdash  the class digit is ignored;otherwise \ldash when \TeX\ is not looking for a delimiter \rdash the rightmost three digits are ignored, and thefour remaining digits are treated as a~\cs{mathchar}; see above.\spoint[successor] Finding a delimiter; successorsTypesetting a delimiter is a somewhat involved affair.\term delimiter sizes\par\term successors\parFirst \TeX\ determines the size $y$ of the formula to be covered,which is twice the maximum of the height and depth of theformula. Thus the formula may not look optimal ifit is not centred itself.The size of the delimiter should be at least \csterm delimiterfactor\par\csterm delimitershortfall\par\cs{delimiterfactor}${}\times y/1000$ and at least $y-{}$\cs{delimitershortfall}.\TeX\ then tries first the small variant, and if that oneis not satisfactory (or if the \n{uvv} part of the delimiteris~\n{000}) it tries the large variant. If trying the large variantdoes not meet with success, \TeX\ takes the largest delimiterencountered in this search; if no delimiter at all was found(which can happen if  the \n{xyy} part is\alttalso~\n{000}),\csterm nulldelimiterspace\paran empty box of width~\cs{nulldelimiterspace} is taken.Investigating a variant means, in sequence,\itemlist \item if the current style (see page~\pgref[math:styles])is scriptscriptstylethe \cs{scriptscriptfont} of the family is tried;\item if the current style is scriptstyle or smallerthe \cs{scriptfont} of the family is tried;\item otherwise the \cs{textfont} of the family is tried.\itemliststopThe plain format puts the \ver-cmex10- font  in all three\term extension fonts\parstyles of family~3.Looking for a delimiter at a certain position in a certain fontmeans\itemlist\item if the character is large enough, accept it;\item if the character is extendable, accept it;\item otherwise, if the character has a successor, that is, it ispart of a chain of increasingly bigger delimiters in the samefont, try the successor.\itemliststopInformation about successors and extensibility of a delimiteris coded in the font metric file of the font.An extendable character has a top, a bottom, possibly a mid piece,and a piece which is repeated directly below the top piece, anddirectly above the bottom piece if there is a mid piece.\spoint \cs{big}, \cs{Big}, \cs{bigg}, and \cs{Bigg}delimiter macrosIn order to be able to use a delimiter outside the \ver-\left...\right- context, or to specify a delimiter ofa different size than \TeX\ would have chosen,four macros for `big' delimiters exist: \cs{big},\cs{Big}, \cs{bigg}, and \cs{Bigg}. These can be used withanything that can follow \cs{left} or \cs{right}.Twelve further macros (for instance \cs{bigl}, \cs{bigm},\csterm big \Style:roman etc.\parand~\cs{bigr}) force such delimiters in the context ofan opening symbol, a binary relation, and a closing symbolrespectively:\Ver>\def\bigl{\mathopen\big}\def\bigm{\mathrel\big} \def\bigr{\mathclose\big}<RevThe `big' macros themselves put the requested delimiter anda null delimiter around an empty vertical box:\Ver>\def\big#1{{\nulldelimiterspace=0pt \mathsurround=0pt            \hbox{$\left#1\vbox to 8.5pt{}\right.$}}}<RevAs an approximate measure,the \n{Big} delimiters are one and a half times as large (11.5pt) as\n{big} delimiters; \n{bigg} ones are twice (14.5pt), and \n{Bigg}ones are two and a half times as large (17.5pt).\point RadicalsA radical is a compound of a left delimiter and an overlinedmath expression.\term radicals\par\csterm radical\parThe overlined expression is set in thecramped version of the surrounding style\alt(see page~\pgref[math:styles]).In the plain format and the Computer Modernmath fonts there is only one radical: the square rootconstruct \Ver>\def\sqrt{\radical"270370 }<RevThe control sequence \cs{radical} is followed by a \gr{24-bit number}which specifies a small and a large variant of the left delimiteras was explained above. Joining the delimiter and the ruleis done by letting the delimiter have a large depth, and a heightwhich is equal to the desired rule thickness. The rule can thenbe placed on the current baseline. After the delimiter and theruled expression have been joined the whole is shifted vertically to achieve the usual vertical centring (see Chapter~\ref[math]).\point Math accentsAccents in math mode are specified by\csterm mathaccent\par\term accents in math mode\par\disp\cs{mathaccent}\gr{15-bit number}\gr{math field}\dispstopRepresenting the 15-bit number as \ver>"xyzz>,only the family~\n{y} and the character position~\n{zz}are used: an accented expression acts as \cs{mathord} expression(see Chapter~\ref[math]).In math mode whole expressions can be accented,\altwhereas in text mode only characters can be accented.Thus in math mode accents can be stacked. However, the topaccent may (or, more likely, will) not be properly positionedhorizontally. Therefore the plain format has a macro \cs{skew}\csterm skew\parthat effectively shifts the top accent. Its definition is\Ver>\def\skew#1#2#3{{#2{#3\mkern#1mu}\mkern-#1mu}{}}<Revand it is used for instance like\Ver>$\skew4\hat{\hat x}$<Rev \message{skew thing.}which gives~{\font\tmp=cmmi10 $\textfont\VMIfam=\tmp\skew4\hat{\hat x}$}.For the correct positioning of accents over single characters\csterm skewchar\parthe symbol and extension font have a \cs{skewchar}:this is the largest accent that adds to the width of anaccented character. Positioning of any accentis based on the width of the character to be accented,followed by the skew character. The skew characters of the Computer Modernmath italic and symbol fonts are character \n{\hex7F},\alt`$\mathchar"!017F$',\message{skew characters}and \n{\hex30}, `$\mathchar"!0230$', respectively. The \cs{defaultskewchar}\csterm defaultskewchar\parvalue is assigned to the \cs{skewchar} when a font is loaded.In plain \TeX\ this is~\n{-1}, so fonts ordinarily have no\cs{skewchar}.Math accents can adapt themselves to the size of the accentedexpression: \TeX\ will look for a successor of an accentin the same way that it looks for a successor of a delimiter.In the Computer Modern math fonts this mechanism is used in\csterm widehat\par\csterm widetilde\parthe \cs{widehat} and \cs{widetilde} macros.For example,\disp\ver>\widehat x>, \ver>\widehat{xy}>, \ver>\widehat{xyz}>\dispstop give\disp$\widehat x$, $\widehat{xy}$, $\widehat{xyz}$\dispstop respectively.\subject[mathfont] Fonts in FormulasFor math typesetting a single current font is not sufficient, as itis for text typesetting. Instead \TeX\ uses several font families,and each family can contain three fonts. This chapterexplains how font families are organized, and how \TeX\ determinesfrom what families characters should be taken.\invent\item fam        The number of the current font family.\item newfam        Allocate a new math font family.\item textfont         Access the textstyle font of a family.\alt\item scriptfont        Access the scriptstyle font of a family.\alt\item scriptscriptfont        Access the scriptscriptstyle font of a family.\alt\inventstop\point Determining the font of a character in math modeThe characters in math formulas can be taken from several\term font families\pardifferent fonts (or better, font families) without any usercommands. For instance, in plain \TeX\ math formulas usethe roman font, the math italic font, the symbol font and the math extension font.In order to determine from which font a character is to betaken, \TeX\ considers for each character in a formula its\cs{mathcode} (this is treated in Chapter~\ref[mathchar]).A~\cs{mathcode} is a 15-bit number of the form\ver."xyzz., where the hex digitshave the following meaning:\disp\n x:~class,\nl\n y:~family,\nl\n{zz}:~position in font.\dispstopIn general only the family determines from what font a character is to be taken.The class of a math character is mostly used tocontrol spacing and other aspects of  typesetting.Typical classes include `relation', `operator', `delimiter'.Class~7 is special in this respect: it is called `variable family'. If a character has a \cs{mathcode} of the form \ver."7yzz.it is taken from family \n{y},unless the parameter \cs{fam} has a value in the range 0--15;then it is taken from family~\cs{fam}.\point Initial family settingsBoth lowercase and uppercase lettersare defined by \IniTeX\ to have math codes \ver>"71zz>,\label[ini:fam]%which means that they are of variable family, initially fromfamily~1.As \TeX\ sets \ver.fam=-1., that is,an invalid value, when a formula starts, characters are indeed taken fromfamily~1, which in plain \TeX\ is math italic.Digits have math code \ver>"70zz> so they are initially fromfamily~0, in plain \TeX\ the roman font. All other character codes have a mathcodeassigned by \IniTeX\ as\disp\cs{mathcode}$\,x=x$\dispstop which puts them in class~0,ordinary, and family~0, roman in plain \TeX.In plain \TeX, commands such as \cs{sl} then set both a font anda family:\Ver>\def\sl{\fam\slfam\tensl}<Revso putting \cs{sl} in a formula will cause all letters, digits,and  uppercase Greek characters, to change toslanted style.In most cases, any font can be assigned to any family, buttwo families in \TeX\ have a special meaning: these arefamilies 2 and~3.For instance, their number of \cs{fontdimen} parametersis different from the usual~7. Family~2 needs 22 parameters,and family~3 needs~13. These parameters have all a veryspecialized meaning for positioning in math typesetting. Their meaning is explained below, but for the full storythe reader is referred to appendix~G of \TeXbook.\point Family definition\TeX\ can access 16 families of fonts in math mode;font families have numbers 0--15. The number of the\csterm fam\parcurrent family is recorded in the parameter~\cs{fam}.The macro \cs{newfam} gives the number of an unused family.\csterm newfam\parThis number is assigned using \cs{chardef} to the control sequence.Each font family can have a font meant for text style, script style,and scriptscript style. Below it is explained how \TeX\determines in what style a (sub-) formula is to be typeset.Fonts are assigned to a family\csterm textfont\par\csterm scriptfont\par\csterm scriptscriptfont\paras follows:\Ver>\newfam\MyFam\textfont\MyFam=\tfont \scriptfont\MyFam=\sfont\scriptscriptfont\MyFam=\ssfont<Revfor the text, script, and scriptscript fonts of a family.In general it is not necessary to fill all three membersof a family (but it is for family~3). If \TeX\ needs a character from a family memberthat has not been filled,it uses the \cs{nullfont} instead,a~primitive font that has no characters (nor a \n{.tfm} file).\point Some specific font changes\spoint Change the font of ordinary characters and uppercase GreekAll letters and the uppercase Greek characters areby default in plain \TeX\ of class~7,variable family, so changing \cs{fam} will change the fontfrom which they are taken.For example\Ver>{\fam=9 x}<Rev  gives an \n{x} from family~9.Uppercase Greek characters are defined by\cs{mathchardef} statements in the plain format as \ver>"70zz>,that is, variable family, initially roman.Therefore, uppercase Greek character also change with the family.\spoint Change uppercase Greek independent of text fontIn the Computer Modern font layout, uppercase Greek lettersare part of the roman font; see page~\pgref[cmr:table].\altTherefore, introducing anothertext font (with another layout)will change the uppercase Greek characters(or even make them disappear).One way of remedying this is by introducing a new family inwhich the \n{cmr} font, which contains the uppercase Greek,resides.The control sequences accessing these characters then haveto be redefined:\Ver>\newfam\Kgreek \textfont\Kgreek=cmr10 ...\def\hex#1{\ifcase#10\or 1\or 2\or 3\or 4\or 5\or 6\or    7\or 8\or 9\or A\or B\or C\or D\or E\or F\fi}\mathchardef\Gamma="0\hex\Kgreek00 % was: "0100\mathchardef\Beta ="0\hex\Kgreek01 % was: "0101\mathchardef\Gamma ...<RevNote, by the way,the absence of a either a space or a \cs{relax} token after\n{\#1} in the definition of \cs{hex}. This implies that thismacro can only be called with an argument that is a control sequence.\spoint Change the font of lowercase Greek        and mathematical symbolsLowercase Greek characters have math code\ver>"01zz>, meaning they are always from the math italic family. In order to change this one might redefine them,for instance \ver.\mathchardef\alpha="710B., to make them variable family.This is not done in plain \TeX, because the Computer Modernroman font does nothave Greek lowercase, although it does have the uppercase characters.Another way is to redefine them like \ver.\mathchardef\alpha="0n0B.where \n{n} is the (hexadecimal) number of a familycompatible with math italic, containing for instance a boldmath italic font.\point Assorted remarks\spoint New fonts in formulasThere are two ways to access a font inside mathematics.\howto Change fonts in a math formula\parAfter \cs{font}""\cs{newfont=....} it is not possible to getthe `a' of the new font by \ver-$...{\newfont a}...$-because \TeX\ does not look at the current font in math mode.What does work is\Ver>$ ... \hbox{\newfont a} ...$<Revbut this precludes the use of the new font in script and scriptscript styles.The proper solution  takes a bit more work:\Ver>\font\newtextfont=... \font\newscriptfont=... \font\newsscriptfont=...\newfam\newfontfam\textfont\newfontfam=\newtextfont\scriptfont\newfontfam=\newscriptfont\scriptscriptfont\newfontfam=\newsscriptfont\def\newfont{\newtextfont \fam=\newfontfam}<Revafter which the font can be used as\Ver>$... {\newfont a_{b_c}} ...$<Revin all three styles.\spoint Evaluating the families\TeX\ will only look at what is actually in the \cs{textfont}et cetera of the various families at the end of the wholeformula. Switching fonts in the families is thus not possibleinside a single formula.The number of 16 families may therefore turn out to be restrictivefor some applications.\subject[math] Mathematics Typesetting\TeX\ has two math modes, display and non-display, andfour styles, display, text, script, and scriptscript style, and\alttevery object in math mode belongs to one of eight classes.This chapter treats these concepts.\invent\item everymath       Token list inserted at the start of a non-display formula.\item everydisplay      Token list inserted at the start of a display formula.\item displaystyle       Select the display style of mathematics typesetting.\item textstyle       Select the text style of mathematics typesetting.\item scriptstyle       Select the script style of mathematics typesetting.\item scriptscriptstyle       Select the scriptscript style of mathematics typesetting.\item mathchoice       Give four variants of a formula for the four styles      of mathematics typesetting.\item mathord       Let the following character or subformula function       as an ordinary object.\item mathop       Let the following character or subformula function       as a large operator.\item mathbin       Let the following character or subformula function       as a binary operation.\item mathrel       Let the following character or subformula function as a relation.\item mathopen       Let the following character or subformula function       as a opening symbol.\item mathclose       Let the following character or subformula function      as a closing symbol.\item mathpunct       Let the following character or subformula function       as a punctuation symbol.\item mathinner       Let the following character or subformula function       as an inner formula.\item mathaccent       Place an accent in math mode.\item vcenter       Construct a vertical box, vertically centred      on the math axis.\item limits       Place limits over and under a large operator.\item nolimits       Place limits of a large operator as subscript and       superscript expressions.\item displaylimits       Restore default placement for limits.\item scriptspace       Extra space after subscripts and superscripts.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{0.5pt}\item nonscript       Cancel the next glue item if it occurs in       scriptstyle or scriptscriptstyle.\item mkern       Insert a kern measured in mu units.\item mskip       Insert glue measured in mu units.\item muskip       Prefix for skips measured in mu units. \item muskipdef       Define a control sequence to be a synonym for      a~\cs{muskip} register.\item newmuskip       Allocate a new muskip register.\item thinmuskip       Small amount of mu glue.\item medmuskip       Medium amount of mu glue.\item thickmuskip       Large amount of mu glue. \item mathsurround       Kern amount placed before and after in-line formulas.\item over      Fraction.\item atop      Place objects over one another.\item above      Fraction with specified bar width. \item overwithdelims      Fraction with delimiters.\item atopwithdelims      Place objects over one another with delimiters.\item abovewithdelims      Generalized fraction with delimiters.\item underline       Underline the following \gr{math symbol} or group.\item overline       Overline the following \gr{math symbol} or group.\item relpenalty       Penalty for breaking after a binary relation      not enclosed in a subformula.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{500}\item binoppenalty       Penalty for breaking after a binary operator not enclosed in      a subformula.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{700}\item allowbreak       Macro for creating a breakpoint.\inventstop\point[math:modes] Math modes\TeX\ changes to math mode when it encounters a math shift\term math modes\par\term math shift character\parcharacter, category~3, in the input. After such an openingmath shift it investigates (without expansion) the nexttoken to see whether this is another math shift.In the latter case \TeX\ starts processing in display math modeuntil a closing double math shift is encountered:\disp\ver> .. $$ >{\italic displayed formula}\ver> $$ ..>\dispstopOtherwise it starts processing an in-line formulain non-display math mode:\disp\ver> .. $ >{\italic in-line formula}\ver> $ ..>\dispstopThe single math shift character is a \gr{horizontal command}.Exception: displays are not possible in restricted horizontalmode, so inside an \cs{hbox} the sequence\ver>$$> is an empty math formula andnot the start of a displayed formula.Associated with the two math modes are two \gr{token parameter}registers (see also Chapter~\ref[token]):at the start of an in-line formula the \cs{everymath} tokens\csterm everymath\parare inserted; at the start of a displayed formula the\cs{everydisplay} tokens are inserted.Display math is treated further in the next chapter.Math modes can be tested for: \cs{ifmmode} is truein display and non-display math mode, and \cs{ifinner}is true in non-display mode, but not in display mode.\point[math:styles] Styles in math modeMath formulas are set in any of eight styles:\term math styles\par\description \item Ddisplay style, \item Ttext style, \item Sscript style, \item SSscriptscript style,\descriptionstopand the four `cramped' variants $D'$, $T'$, $S'$, $SS'$ of\term cramped styles\parthese. The cramped styles differ mainly in thefact that superscripts are not raised as far as inthe original styles.\spoint Superscripts and subscripts\TeX\ can typeset a symbol or group\term superscript\par\term subscript\paras a superscript (or subscript) to the precedingsymbol or group, if that preceding itemdoes not already have a superscript(subscript). Superscripts (subscripts) are specified bythe syntax\disp\gr{superscript}\gr{math field}\dispstopor \disp\gr{subscript}\gr{math field}\dispstopwhere a \gr{superscript} (\gr{subscript}) is either a characterof category~7 (8), or a control sequence \cs{let} to sucha character.The plain format has the control\csterm\char94\par\csterm\char95\parsequences\Ver>\let\sp=^ \let\sb=_<Rev as implicit superscriptand subscript characters.Specifying a superscript (subscript) expression as the firstitem in an empty math list is equivalent to specifyingit as the superscript (subscript) of an empty expression.For instance, \disp\ver>$^{...}>\quad is equivalent to\quad \ver>${}^{...}>\dispstopFor \TeX's internal calculations, superscript and subscriptexpressions are made wider by \cs{scriptspace};\csterm scriptspace\parthe value of this in plain \TeX\ is~\n{0.5pt}.\spoint Choice of stylesOrdering the four styles $D$, $T$, $S$, and~$SS$, andconsidering the other four as mere variants, thestyle rules for math mode are as follows:\itemlist\item In any style superscripts and subscriptsare taken from the next smaller style. Exception:in display style they are taken in script style.\item Subscripts are always in the cramped variant ofthe style; superscripts are only cramped if the originalstyle was cramped.\item In an \ver-{..\over..}- formula in any stylethe numerator and denominator are taken from the nextsmaller style.\item The denominator is always in cramped style;the numerator is only in cramped style if the originalstyle was cramped.\item Formulas under a \cs{sqrt} or \cs{overline}are in cramped style.\itemliststopStyles can be forced by the explicit commands\alt\csterm displaystyle\par\csterm textstyle\par\csterm scriptstyle\par\csterm scriptscriptstyle\par\cs{displaystyle}, \cs{textstyle}, \cs{scriptstyle},and~\cs{scriptscriptstyle}.In display style and text style the \cs{textfont} of thecurrent family is used, in scriptstyle the \cs{scriptfont} is used, and in\altscriptscriptstyle the \cs{scriptscriptfont} is used.The primitive command\csterm mathchoice\par\disp\cs{mathchoice}\lb {\it D\/\rb\lb T\/\rb\lb S\/\rb\lb SS\/}\rb\dispstoplets the user specify four variants of a formula for thefour styles. \TeX\ constructs all four and inserts the appropriate one.\point[math:class] Classes of mathematical objectsObjects in math mode belong to one of eight classes. Depending\term math classes\paron the class the object may be surrounded bysome amount of white space,or treated specially in some way. Commands exist to forcesymbols, or sequences of symbols, to act asbelonging to a certain class.In the hexadecimal representation \ver>"xyzz>the class is the \gr{3-bit number}~\n x.This is the list of classes and commands that force thoseclasses. The examples are from the plain format (see the tables starting at page~\pgref[math:sym:tables]).\enumerate \SetCounter:item=-1\item {\em ordinary\/}: lowercase Greek characters and those symbols      that are `just symbols';       the command \cs{mathord} forces this class.\csterm mathord\par\item {\em large operator\/}: integral and sum signs,      and `big' objects such as \cs{bigcap} or \cs{bigotimes};      the command \cs{mathop} forces this class.\csterm mathop\par      Characters that are      large operators are centred vertically, and they      may behave differently in display style from in the      other styles; see below.\item {\em binary operation\/}: plus and minus,      and things such as \cs{cap} or \cs{otimes};      the command \cs{mathbin} forces this class.\csterm mathbin\par\item {\em relation\/} (also called {\em binary relation\/}):       equals, less than, and greater than signs, subset and      superset, perpendicular, parallel;      the command \cs{mathrel} forces this class.\csterm mathrel\par\item {\em opening symbol\/}: opening brace, bracket, parenthesis, angle, \altt      floor, ceiling;      the command \cs{mathopen} forces this class.\csterm mathopen\par\item {\em closing symbol\/}: closing brace, bracket, parenthesis, angle, \altt      floor, ceiling;      the command \cs{mathclose} forces this class.\csterm mathclose\par\item {\em punctuation\/}: most punctuation marks, but      \n:~is a relation, the \cs{colon} is a punctuation colon;      the command \cs{mathpunct} forces this class.\csterm mathpunct\par\item {\em variable family\/}: symbols in this class change font      with the \cs{fam} parameter; in plain \TeX\ uppercase      Greek letters and ordinary letters and digits are      in this class.\enumeratestopThere is one further class: the {\em inner\/} subformulas.No characters can be assigned to this class, but characters andsubformulas can be forced into it by \cs{mathinner}.\csterm mathinner\parThe \gr{generalized fraction}s and \ver-\left...\right- groupsare inner formulas. Inner formulas are surroundedby some white space; see the table below.Other subformulas than those that are inner are treated asordinary symbols. In particular, subformulas enclosed inbraces are ordinary: \ver-$a+b$- looks like `$a\mathop+b$', but\message{Check a+b look}%\ver-$a{+}b$- looks like~`$a{+}b$'. Note, however, thatin \ver-${a+b}$- the whole subformula is treated as anordinary symbol, not its components; therefore the result is~`${a+b}$'.\point Large operators and their limitsThe large operators in the Computer Modern fonts come intwo sizes: one for text style and one for display style.Control sequences such as \cs{sum} are simply defined by\cs{mathchardef} to correspond to a position in a font:\Ver>\mathchardef\sum="1350<Rev but if thecurrent style is display style, \TeX\ looks to see whetherthat character has a successor in the font.Large operators in text style behave as if they are followed\csterm limits\par\csterm nolimits\parby \cs{nolimits}, which places the limits as sub/superscriptexpressions after theoperator:\disp$\sum_{k=1}^\infty$\dispstopIn display style they behave as if they are followed by\cs{limits}, which places the limits over and underthe operator:\disp$\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty$\dispstopThe successor mechanism (see page~\pgref[successor])\altlets \TeX\ take a larger variantof the delimiter here.The integral sign has been defined in plain \TeX\ as\Ver>\mathchardef\intop="1352 \def\int{\intop\nolimits}<Revwhich places the limits after the operator, even in display style:\disp$\displaystyle\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2}\,dx=\sqrt{\pi}/2$\dispstopWith \ver-\limits\nolimits- or \ver-\nolimits\limits- the\csterm displaylimits\parlast specification has precedence; the default placementcan be restored by \cs{displaylimits}. For instance,\Ver>$ ... \sum\limits\displaylimits ... $<Revis equivalent to \Ver>$ ... \sum ... $<Rev and \Ver>$$ ... \sum\nolimits\displaylimits ... $$<Revis equivalent to\Ver>$$ ... \sum ... $$<Rev\point Vertical centring: \cs{\vcenter}Each formula has an {\em axis\/}, which is for an in-line\term axis of math formulas\par\term centring of math formulas\parformula about half the x-height of the surroundingtext; the exact value is the \cs{fontdimen22} of thefont in family~2, the symbol font, in the current style.The bar line in fractions is placed on the axis; largeoperators, delimiters and \cs{vcenter} boxes are centred on it.A \cs{vcenter}\label[vcenter]box is a vertical box that is arranged\csterm vcenter\parso that it is centred on the math axis.It is possible to give a \n{spread} or \n{to}specification with a \cs{vcenter} box.The \cs{vcenter} box is allowed only in math mode, andit does not behave like other boxes; for instance, it cannot be stored in a box register. It does not qualify asa~\gr{box}. See page~\pgref[tvcenter] for a macro thatrepairs this.\point[muglue] Mathematical spacing: \n{mu} glueSpacing around mathematical objects is measured in \n{mu}\term math spacing\par\term math unit\par\term mu glue\parunits. A~\n{mu} is $1/18$th part of \cs{fontdimen6}of the font in family~2 in the current style,the `quad' value of the symbol font.\spoint Classification of \n{mu} glueThe user can specify \n{mu} spacing by \cs{mkern} or~\cs{mskip},\csterm mkern\par\csterm mskip\parbut most \n{mu} glue is inserted automatically by \TeX,based on the classes to which objects belong (see above).First, here are some rules of thumb describing the global behaviour.\itemlist \item A \cs{thickmuskip} (default value in plain\TeX: \n{5mu plus 5mu})\csterm thickmuskip\paris inserted around (binary) relations, except where these arepreceded or followed by other relations or punctuation, andexcept if they follow an open, or precede a close symbol.\item A \cs{medmuskip} (default value in plain\csterm medmuskip\par\TeX: \n{4mu plus 2mu minus 4mu}) is put around binary operators.\item A \cs{thinmuskip} \csterm thinmuskip\par(default value in plain \TeX: \n{3mu}) follows afterpunctuation, and is put around inner objects, except where theseare followed by a close or preceded by an open symbol, andexcept if the other object is a large operator or abinary relation.\item No \n{mu} glue is inserted after an open or before a closesymbol except where the latter is preceded by punctuation;no \n{mu} glue is inserted also before punctuation, except wherethe preceding object is punctuation or an inner object.\itemliststop The following table gives the complete definition of mu gluebetween math objects.\disp\leavevmode\vbox{\offinterlineskip    \halign{#\enspace\hfil&#\enspace\hfil\vrule           &&\hfil\enspace#\hfil\strut\cr    \omit\hfil&\omit\hfil& 0:& 1:& 2:& 3:& 4:& 5:& 6:\cr    \omit\hfil&\omit\hfil&\hfill Ord&\hfill Op&\hfill Bin&\hfill Rel&                  \hfill Open&\hfill Close&\hfill Punct&\hfill Inner\cr    \omit\hfil&\omit\hfil&\multispan8\hrulefill\cr    0:&Ord&    0&  1&(2)&(3)&  0&  0&  0&(1)\cr    1:&Op&     1&  1&  *&(3)&  0&  0&  0&(1)\cr    2:&Bin&  (2)&(2)&  *&  *&(2)&  *&  *&(2)\cr    3:&Rel&  (3)&(3)&  *&  0&(2)&  *&  *&(2)\cr    4:&Open&   0&  0&  *&  0&  0&  0&  0&  0\cr    5:&Close&  0&  1&(2)&(3)&  0&  0&  0&(1)\cr    6:&Punct&(1)&(1)&  *&(1)&(1)&(1)&(1)&(1)\cr      &Inner&(1)&  1&(2)&(3)&(1)&  0&(1)&(1)\cr%    \omit\hfil&\omit\hfil&\multispan8\hrulefil\cr}}\>where the symbols have the following meanings:\itemlist\item 0, no space; 1, thin space; 2, medium space;     3, thick space;\item $(\cdot)$, insert only in text and display     mode, not in script or scriptscript mode;\item    cases * cannot occur, because a Bin object is converted    to Ord if it is the first in the list, preceded by    Bin, Op, Open, Punct, Rel, or followed by Close,    Punct, and Rel; also, a Rel is converted to Ord when    \alt    it is followed by Close or Punct.\>Stretchable \n{mu} glue is set according to the same rules thatgovern ordinary glue. However, only \n{mu} glue on the outerlevel can be stretched or shrunk; any \n{mu} glue enclosedin  a~group is set at natural width.\spoint Muskip registersLike ordinary glue, \n{mu} glue can be stored in registers,\csterm muskip\par\csterm muskipdef\par\csterm newmuskip\parthe \cs{muskip} registers,of which there are 256 in \TeX. The registers are denoted by\disp\cs{muskip}\gr{8-bit number}\dispstopand they can be assigned to a control sequence by\disp\cs{muskipdef}\gr{control sequence}\gr{equals}\gr{8-bit number}\dispstopand there is a macro that allocates unused registers:\disp\cs{newmuskip}\gr{control sequence}\dispstopArithmetic for mu glue exists as for glue; seeChapter~\ref[glue].\spoint Other spaces in math modeIn math mode space tokens are ignored; however,the math code of the space character is \ver-"8000-in plain \TeX,so if its category is made `letter' or `other character', itwill behave like an active character in math mode.See also page~\pgref[mcode:8000].Admissible glue in math mode is of type~\gr{mathematical skip},which is either a \gr{horizontal skip} (see Chapter~\ref[hvmode]) or~\cs{mskip}\gr{muglue}. Leaders in math mode can be specifiedwith a \gr{mathematical skip}.A glue item preceded by \cs{nonscript}\csterm nonscript\paris cancelled if it occurs in scriptstyle or scriptscriptstyle.Control space functions in math mode\altas it does in horizontal mode.In-line formulas are surrounded by kerns of size\csterm mathsurround\par\cs{mathsurround}, the so-called `math-on' and`math-off' items. Line breaking can occur at the front ofthe math-off kern if it is followed by glue.\point Generalized fractionsFraction-like objects can be set with six primitive commandsof type \gr{generalized fraction}.\term generalized fractions\parEach of these takes the preceding and the following subformulasand puts them over one another, if necessary with a fractionbar and with delimiters.\description \item \cs{over}   is the ordinary fraction; the bar thickness is \cs{fontdimen8}   \csterm over\par   of the extension font:    \disp\ver>$\pi\over2$>\quad gives\quad `$\pi\over2$'\message{pi over 2}\>\item \cs{atop}   \csterm atop\par   is equivalent to a fraction with zero bar thickness:   \disp\ver>$\pi\atop2$>\quad gives\quad `$\pi\atop2$'\dispstop\item \cs{above}\gr{dimen}   specifies the thickness   \csterm above\par   of the bar line explicitly:   \disp\ver>$\pi\above 1pt 2$>\quad gives\quad `$\pi\above 1pt 2$'\dispstop\descriptionstop To each of these three there corresponds a \cs{...withdelims} variant\csterm overwithdelims\par\csterm atopwithdelims\par\csterm abovewithdelims\parthat lets the user specify delimiters for the expression.For example, the most general command, in terms of whichall five others could have been defined, is\disp\cs{abovewithdelims}\gr{delim$_1$}\gr{delim$_2$}\gr{dimen}.\dispstopDelimiters in these generalized fractions do not grow with theenclosed expression: in display mode a delimiter is takenwhich is at least \cs{fontdimen20} high, otherwise\altit has to beat least \cs{fontdimen21} high.These dimensions are takenfrom the font in family~2, the symbol font, in the current style.The control sequences \cs{over}, \cs{atop}, and \cs{above}are primitives, although they could have been definedas \cs{...withdelims..}, that is, with two null delimiters.Because of these implied surrounding null delimiters,there is a kern of size \cs{nulldelimiterspace} before and afterthese simple generalized fractions. \point Underlining, overliningThe primitive commands \cs{underline} and \cs{overline} take a \csterm underline\par\csterm overline\par\gr{math field} argument, that is, a \gr{math symbol} ora group, and draw a line under or over it.The result is an `Under' or `Over' atom, whichis appended to the current math list.The line thickness is font dimension~8 of the extension font,which also determines the clearance between the line andthe \gr{math field}.Various other \cs{over...} and \cs{under...} commands existin plain \TeX;these are all macrosthat use the \TeX\ \cs{halign} command.\point Line breaking in math formulasIn-line formulas can be broken after relations and binary operators.\csterm relpenalty\par\csterm binoppenaly\par\term penalties in math mode\parThe respective penalties are the \cs{relpenalty} and the~\cs{binoppenalty}. However, \TeX\ will only breakafter such symbols if they are not enclosed in braces.Other breakpoints can be created with~\cs{allowbreak},\csterm allowbreak\par\term breakpoints in math lists\parwhich is an abbreviation for~\cs{penalty0}.Unlike in horizontal or vertical mode where putting two penaltiesin a row is equivalent to just placing the smallest one,in math mode a penalty placed at a break point \ldash that is,after a relation or binary operator \rdash  will effectivelyreplace the old penalty by the new one.\point[fam23:fontdims] Font dimensions of families 2 and 3If a font is used in text mode, \TeX\ will look at itsfirst 7 \cs{fontdimen} parameters(see page~\pgref[font:dims]), for instance tocontrol spacing.In math, however, more font dimensions are needed.\TeX\ will look at the first 22 parameters of thefonts in family~2, and the first 13 of the fonts infamily~3, to control variousaspects of math typesetting. The next two subsectionshave been quoted loosely from~\cite[BB:ISO].\spoint Symbol font attributesAttributes of the font in family 2 mainly specify the\term symbol font\parinitial vertical positioningof parts of fractions, subscripts, superscripts, et cetera.The position determined by applying theseattributes may be further modified because of otherconditions, for example the presence of a fraction bar.One text font dimension, number~6,the quad, determines the size of mu glue;see above.Fraction numerator attributes: minimum shift up, fromthe main baseline, of the baseline of the numeratorof a generalized fraction,\enumerate \SetCounter:item=7\item num1: for display style,\item num2: for text style or smaller if a fraction bar is present,\item num3: for text style or smaller if no fraction bar is present.\>Fraction denominator attributes: minimum shift down, fromthe main baseline, of the baseline of the denominatorof a generalized fraction,\enumerate \SetCounter:item=10\item denom1:for display style,\item denom2:for text style or smaller.\>Superscript attributes: minimum shift up, from the main baseline,of the baseline of a superscript,\enumerate \SetCounter:item=12\item sup1:for display style,\item sup2:for text style or smaller, non-cramped,\item sup3:for text style or smaller, cramped.\>Subscript attributes: minimum shift down, from the main baseline,of the baseline of a subscript,\enumerate \SetCounter:item=15\item sub1:when no superscript is present,\item sub2:when a superscript is present.\>Script adjustment attributes: for use only with non-glyph,that is, composite, objects.\enumerate \SetCounter:item=17\item sup\_drop:maximum distance of superscript baseline below top of nucleus\item sub\_drop:minimum distance of subscript baseline below bottom of nucleus.\>Delimiter span attributes: height plus depth of delimiter enclosinga generalized fraction,\enumerate \SetCounter:item=19\item delim1:in display style,\item delim2:in text style or smaller.\>A parameter with many uses, the height of the math axis,\enumerate \SetCounter:item=21\item axis\_height:the height above the baselineof the fraction bar, and the centre of large delimitersand most operators and relations. This position isused in vertical centring operations.\>\spoint Extension font attributesAttributes of the font in family 3 mostly specifythe way the limits of large operators are set.The first parameter, number 8, default\_rule\_thickness,serves many purposes. Itis the thickness of the rule used for overlines,underlines, radical extenders (square root), and fraction bars. Various clearances are  also specifiedin terms of this dimension: between the fraction bar andthe numerator and denominator, between an object andthe rule drawn by an underline, overline, or radical,and between the bottom of superscripts and top of subscripts.Minimum clearances around large operators are as follows:\enumerate \SetCounter:item=8\item big\_op\_spacing1:minimum clearance between baseline of upper limit and topof large operator; see below.\item big\_op\_spacing2:minimum clearance between bottom of large operator and top of lower limit.\item big\_op\_spacing3:minimum clearance between baseline ofupper limit and top of large operator,taking into account depth of upper limit; see below.\item big\_op\_spacing4:minimum clearance between bottom of large operator and top of lowerlimit, taking into account height of lower limit; see below.\item big\_op\_spacing5:clearance above upper limit or below lower limit of a large operator.\>The resulting clearance above an operator is the maximumof parameter~7, and parameter~11 minus the depth of theupper limit.The resulting clearance below an operator is the maximumof parameter~10, and parameter~12 minus the height of thelower limit.\spoint Example: subscript loweringThe location of a subscript depends on whether there\alt\howto Adjust subscript lowering\paris a superscript; for instance\disp $X_1+Y^2_1=1$\>If you would rather have that look like\disp $\global\tempdima=\fontdimen16\textfont2\relax       \global\tempdimb=\fontdimen17\textfont2\relax       \fontdimen16\textfont2=3pt \fontdimen17\textfont2=3pt       X_1+Y^2_1=1$,$\fontdimen16\textfont2=\tempdima\relax                     \fontdimen17\textfont2=\tempdimb\relax$\>\message{check lowering}it suffices to specify\Ver>\fontdimen16\textfont2=3pt \fontdimen17\textfont2=3pt<Revwhich makes the subscript drop equal in both cases.\subject[displaymath] Display MathDisplayed formulas are set on a line of their own, usuallysomewhere in a paragraph. This chapter explainshow surrounding white space (both above/below and to theleft/right) is calculated.\invent\item abovedisplayskip \cs{belowdisplayskip}      Glue above/""below a display.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{12pt plus 3pt minus 9pt}\item abovedisplayshortskip \cs{belowdisplayshortskip}      Glue above/""below a display if the line preceding the display       was short.      Plain \TeX\ defaults:~\n{0pt plus 3pt} and      \n{7pt plus 3pt minus 4pt} respectively.\item predisplaypenalty \cs{postdisplaypenalty}      Penalty placed in the vertical list above/""below a display.      Plain \TeX\ defaults:~\n{10$\,$000} and~\n{0}      respectively.\item displayindent       Distance by which the box, in which the display       is centred, is indented owing to hanging indentation.\item displaywidth       Width of the box in which the display is centred.\item predisplaysize       Effective width of the line preceding the display.\item everydisplay       Token list inserted at the start of a display.\item eqno       Place a right equation number in a display formula.\item leqno       Place a left equation number in a display formula.\inventstop\point Displays\TeX\ starts building a display when it encounters two\term displays\parmath shift characters (characters of category~3,\ver>$>~in plain \TeX) in a row.Another such pair (possibly followed\alt by one optional space) indicates the end of the display.Math shift is a \gr{horizontal command}, but displays are onlyallowed in unrestricted horizontal mode(\ver>$$>~is an empty math formula in restricted horizontal mode).Displays themselves, however, are started in thesurrounding (possibly internal) vertical mode in order to calculatequantities such as~\cs{prevgraf}; the result of the display isappended to the vertical list.The part of the paragraph above the display is broken intolines as an independent paragraph (but \cs{prevgraf} iscarried over; see below), and the remainder of theparagraph is set, starting with an empty list and \cs{spacefactor}equal to~1000. The \cs{everypar} tokens are not inserted for the part of theparagraph after the display, nor is \cs{parskip} glue inserted. Right at the beginning of the display the \cs{everydisplay}\csterm everydisplay\partoken list is inserted (but after the calculation of\cs{displayindent}, \cs{displaywidth}, and \cs{predisplaysize}).See page~\pgref[left:display] for an example of the useof \cs{everydisplay}.The page builder is exercisedbefore the display (but after the \cs{everydisplay} tokens have been inserted),and after the display finishes.The `display style' of math typesetting was treated in Chapter~\ref[mathfont].\point Displays in paragraphsPositioning of a display in a paragraph may be influencedby hanging indentation or a \cs{parshape} specification.For this, \TeX\ uses the \cs{prevgraf} parameter(see Chapter~\ref[par:shape]), andacts as if the display is three lines deep.If $n$ is the value of \cs{prevgraf} when the display starts\ldash so there are $n$ lines of text above the display \rdash \cs{prevgraf} is set to to $n+3$ when the paragraph resumes.The display occupies, as it were, lines $n+1$, $n+2$, and~$n+3$.The shift and line width for the display are thosethat would hold for line~$n+2$.The shift for the display is recorded in \cs{displayindent};\csterm displayindent\par\csterm displaywidth\parthe line width is recorded in \cs{displaywidth}. These parameters(and the \cs{predisplaysize} explained below)are set immediately after the \ver>$$> has been scanned.Usually they are equal to zero and \cs{hsize} respectively.The user can change the values of these parameters; \TeX\ will use thevalues that hold after the math list of the display has been processed.Note that a display is vertical material, and thereforenot influenced by settings of \cs{leftskip} and \cs{rightskip}.\point Vertical material around displaysA display is preceded in the vertical list by\itemlist\item a penalty of size \cs{predisplaypenalty}   \csterm predisplaypenalty\par\csterm abovedisplayskip\par   \csterm abovedisplayshortskip\par(plain \TeX\ default~$10\,000$), and\item glue of size \cs{abovedisplayskip} or \cs{abovedisplayshortskip}; this glue is omitted incases where a~\cs{leqno} equation number is set ona line of its own (see below).\itemliststopA display is followed by \itemlist\item a penalty of size \cs{postdisplaypenalty}   \csterm postdisplaypenalty\par\csterm belowdisplayskip\par   \csterm belowdisplayshortskip\par(default~0), and possibly\item glue of size \cs{belowdisplayskip} or \cs{belowdisplayshortskip}; this glue is omitted in caseswhere an~\cs{eqno} equation number is set on a line ofits own (see below).\itemliststopThe `short' variants of the glue are taken ifthere is no \cs{leqno} left equation number, and ifthe last line of the paragraph above the display isshort enough for the display to be raised a bit withoutcoming too close to that line.In order to decide this, the effective width of thepreceding line is saved in \cs{predisplaysize}.    \csterm predisplaysize\parThis value is calculated immediately after the opening \ver>$$>of the display hasbeen scanned, together with the \cs{displaywidth}and \cs{displayindent} explained above.Remembering that the part of the paragraph above the displayhas already been broken into lines, the following methodfor finding the effective width of the last line ensues.\TeX\ takes the last box of the list, which is a horizontalbox containing the last line, and locates the right edgeof the last box in it. The \cs{predisplaysize} is thenthe place of that rightmost edge, plus any amount by whichthe last line was shifted, plus two ems in the current font.There are two exceptions to this. The \cs{predisplaysize}is taken to be $-$\cs{maxdimen} if there was no previous line,that is,the display started the paragraph, or it followed another display;\cs{predisplaysize} is taken to be \cs{maxdimen}\term machine dependence\parif the glue in the last line was not set at its natural width,which may happen if the \cs{parfillskip} contained only finitestretch. The reason for the last clause is that gluesetting is slightly machine"-dependent, and such dependencesshould be kept out of \TeX's global decision processes.\point Glue setting of the display math listThe display has to fit in \cs{displaywidth}, but in addition to the formula theremay be an equation number. The minimum separationbetween the formula and the equation number shouldbe one em in the symbol font, that is,\cs{font\-dimen\-6}""\cs{textfont2}.If the formula plus any equation numberand separation fit into \cs{displaywidth},the glue in the formula is set at its natural width. If it does not fit,but the formula contains enough shrink, it is shrunk.Otherwise \TeX\ puts any equation numberon a line of its own, and the glue in the formula isset to fit it in \cs{displaywidth}.With the equationnumber on a separate line the formula may now very well fit in thedisplay width; however,if it was a very long formula the box in which it isset may still be overfull. \TeX\ nevers breaks a displayedformula.\point Centring the display formula: displacementBased on the width of the box containing the formula \ldash whichmay not really `contain' it; it may be overfull \rdash \TeX\ tries to centre the formula in the \cs{displaywidth},that is, without taking the equation number into account.Initially, a displacement is calculated that is half the difference between \cs{displaywidth} and thewidth of the formula box.However, if there is an equation number that will notbe put on a separate line and the displacement is less thantwice the width of the equation number, a new displacementis calculated. This new displacement is zero if the formulastarted with glue; otherwise it is such that theformula box is centred in the space left by the equationnumber.If there was no equation number, or if the equation numberwill be put on a separate line, the formula boxis now placed, shifted right by \cs{displayindent} plusthe displacement calculated above.\point Equation numbersThe user can specify a equation number for a displayby ending it with \csterm eqno\par\csterm leqno\par\term equation numbering\par\Disp\cs{eqno}\gr{math mode material}\ver>$$>\Dispstopfor an equation number placed on the right, or\Disp\cs{leqno}\gr{math mode material}\ver>$$>\Dispstopfor an equation number placed on the left.\spoint Ordinary equation numbersAbove it was described how \TeX\ calculates a displacementfrom the display formula and the equation number, if thisis to be put on the same line as the formula.If the equation number was a  \cs{leqno} number,\TeX\ places a box containing\itemlist\item the equation number,\item a kern with the size of the displacement calculated, and\item the formula.\itemliststopThis box is shifted right by \cs{displayindent}.If the equation number was an \cs{eqno} number,\TeX\ places a box containing\itemlist\item the formula,\item a kern with the size of the displacement calculated, and\item the equation number.\itemliststopThis box is shifted right by \cs{displayindent} plusthe displacement calculated.\spoint The equation number on a separate lineSince displayed formulas may become rather big, \TeX\ can decide(as was described above)that any equation number should be placed on a line of its own.A~left-placed equation number is then to be placed above thedisplay, in a box that is shifted right by \cs{displayindent};a right-placed equation number will be placed below the display,in a box that is shifted to the right by \cs{displayindent} plus \cs{displaywidth} minus the width ofthe equation number box.In both cases a penalty of $10\,000$ is placed between the equationnumber box and the formula.\TeX\ does not put extra glue above a left-placedequation number or belowa right-placed equation number; \TeX\ here relies onthe baselineskip mechanism.\point[left:display] Non-centred displaysAs a default, \TeX\ will centre displays.\term displays, non-centred\parIn order to get non-centred displays somemacro trickery is needed. One approach wouldbe to write a macro \cs{DisplayEquation}that would basically look like\Ver>\def\DisplayEquation#1{%    \par \vskip\abovedisplayskip    \hbox{\kern\parindent$\displaystyle#1$}    \vskip\belowdisplayskip \noindent}<Revbut it would be nicer if one could just write\Ver>$$ ... \eqno ... $$<Revand having this come out as a left"-aligning display.Using the \cs{everydisplay} token list, the aboveidea can be realized. The basic idea is to write\Ver>\everydisplay{\IndentedDisplay}\def\IndentedDisplay#1$${ ...<Revso that the macro \cs{IndentedDisplay}will receive the formula, including any equation number.The first step is now to extract an equation numberif it is present. This makes creative use of delimitedmacro parameters.\Ver>\def\ExtractEqNo#1\eqno#2\eqno#3\relax   {\def\Equation{#1}\def\EqNo{#2}}\def\IndentedDisplay#1$${%    \ExtractEqNo#1\eqno\eqno\relax<RevNext the equation should be set in the availablespace \cs{displaywidth}:\Ver>    \hbox to \displaywidth        {\kern\parindent         $\displaystyle\Equation$\hfil$\EqNo$}$$    }<RevNote that the macro ends in the closing \ver>$$>to balance the opening dollars that causedinsertion of the \cs{everydisplay} tokens.This also means that the box containing thedisplayed material will automatically besurrounded by \cs{abovedisplayskip} and\cs{belowdisplayskip} glue.There is no need to use \cs{displayindent} anywherein this macro, because \TeX\ itself will shift thedisplay appropriately.\endinputbaselineskip around displays?
