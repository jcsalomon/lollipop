\subject[page:shape]  Page ShapeThis chapter treats some of the parameters that determine the size of the page and how it appears on paper.\invent\item topskip       Minimum distance between the top of the page box      and the baseline of the first box on the page.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{10pt}\item hoffset \cs{voffset}      Distance by which the page is shifted right/""down       with respect to the reference point.\item vsize       Height of the page box.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{8.9in}\item maxdepth       Maximum depth of the page box.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{4pt}\item splitmaxdepth       Maximum depth of a box split off by a \cs{vsplit} operation.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\cs{maxdimen}\inventstop\point The reference point for global positioningIt is a \TeX\ convention, to which output device drivers\term page positioning\parmust adhere, that the top left point of the page isone inch from the page edges. Unfortunately thismay lead to lots of trouble, for instance if a printer(or the page description language it uses)takes, say, the {\em lower\/} left corner as thereference point, and is factory set to US paper sizes,but is used with European standard A4 paper.The page is shifted on the paper if one assigns non-zero\csterm hoffset\par\csterm voffset\parvalues to \cs{hoffset} or \cs{voffset}: positive valuesshift to the right and down respectively.\point \cs{\topskip}The \cs{topskip} ensures to a certain point\csterm topskip\parthat the first baseline of a pagewill be at the same location from page to page,even if font sizesare switched between pages or if the first line hasno ascenders.Before the first box on each page some glue is inserted.This glue has the same stretch and shrink as \cs{topskip}, butthe natural size is the natural size of \cs{topskip}minus the height of the first box, or zero if thiswould be negative.Plain \TeX\ sets \cs{topskip} to {\tt 10pt}.Thus the top lines of pages will have their baselinesat the same place ifthe top portion of the characters is ten point or less.For the Computer Modern fonts this condition is satisfiedif the font size is less than (about) 13~points; for larger fontsthe baseline of the top line will drop.The height of the page box for a page containing onlytext (and assuming a zero \cs{parskip})will be the \cs{topskip} plus a number of timesthe \cs{baselineskip}. Thus one can define a macroto compute the \cs{vsize} from the number of lineson a page:\howto Specify page height in lines\par\Ver>\def\HeightInLines#1{\count@=#1\relax    \advance\count@ by -1\relax    \vsize=\baselineskip    \multiply\vsize by \count@    \advance\vsize by \topskip}<RevCalculating the \cs{vsize} this way will preventunderfull boxes for text-only pages.In cases where the page does not start with a line of text(for instance a rule), the topskip may give unwanted effects.To prevent these, start the page with\Ver>\hbox{}\kern-\topskip<Revfollowed by what you wanted on top. Analogous to the \cs{topskip}, there is a \cs{splittopskip}for pages generated by a \cs{vsplit} operation; seethe next chapter.\point Page height and depth\TeX\ tries to build pages as a \cs{vbox} of height \cs{vsize};\alt\csterm vsize\parsee also \cs{pagegoal} in the next chapter.If the last item on a page has an excessive depth,\term page depth\parthat page would be noticeably longer than other pages.To prevent this phenomenon \TeX\ uses \cs{maxdepth} as\csterm maxdepth\parthe maximum depth of the page box. If adding an item to thepage would make the depth exceed this quantity, then thereference point of the page is moved down to make the depthexactly \cs{maxdepth}.The `raggedbottom' effect is obtained in plain \TeX\\csterm raggedbottom\parby giving the \cs{topskip} some finite stretchability:\hbox{\n{10pt plus 60pt}}.Thus the natural height of box~255 can vary when it reachesthe output routine.Pages are then shipped out (more or less) as\Ver>\dimen0=\dp255 \unvbox255\ifraggedbottom \kern-\dimen0 \vfil \fi <RevThe \cs{vfil} causes the topskip to be set at naturalwidth, so the effect is one of a fixed top line  and avariable bottom line of the page.Before \cs{box255} is unboxed in the plain \TeX\ output routine,\cs{boxmaxdepth} is set to \cs{maxdepth}so that this box will made under the same assumptionsthat the page builder used when putting together \cs{box255}.The depth of box split off by a \cs{vsplit} operationis controlled by the \cs{splitmaxdepth} parameter.\subject[page:break]  Page BreakingThis chapter treats the `page builder': the part of \TeX\that decides where to break the main vertical list into pages.The page builder operates before the output routine,and it hands its result in \cs{box255} to the output routine.\invent\item vsplit      Split of a top part of a box. This is comparable      with page breaking.\item splittopskip       Minimum distance between the top of what remains after a      \cs{vsplit} operation, and the first item in that box.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{10pt}\item pagegoal       Goal height of the page box.

This is the mechanismthat lets glue disappear after a page break and at the top ofthe first page. When the first non-discardable item is movedto the current page, the \cs{topskip} glue is inserted;see the previous chapter.The workings of the page builder can be made visible bysetting \cs{tracingpages} to some positive value(see Chapter~\ref[trace]).\point Activating the page builderThe page builder comes into play  in thefollowing circumstances.\itemlist\item Around paragraphs: after the \cs{everypar}    tokens have been inserted, and after the paragraph has been    added to the vertical list. See the end of this chapter for     an example.\item Around display formulas: after the \cs{everydisplay}    tokens have been inserted, and after the display has been    added to the list.\item After \cs{par} commands, boxes, insertions,     and explicit penalties in vertical mode. \item After an output routine has ended. \>In these places the page builder moves the recentcontributions to the current page. Note that \TeX\ need not be in vertical mode when the page builder is exercised.In horizontal mode, activating the page builderserves to move preceding vertical glue (for example, \cs{parskip},\cs{abovedisplayskip}) to the page.The \cs{end} command \ldash which is only allowed inexternal vertical mode \rdash  terminates a \TeX\ job, but only if themain vertical list is empty and \cs{deadcycles}${}=0$.If this is not the case the combination\label[end:play]%\disp\ver>\hbox{}\vfill\penalty>$-2^{30}$\dispstopis appended, which forces the output routine to act.\point Page length bookkeepingThe height and depth of the page box that reaches the output\term page length\parroutine are determined by \cs{vsize}, \cs{topskip},and~\cs{maxdepth} as described in the previous chapter.\TeX\ places the \cs{topskip} gluewhen the first box is placed on the current page; the\cs{vsize} and \cs{maxdepth} are read when the firstbox or insertion occurs on the page. Any subsequent changes to theseparameters will not be noticeable until the next page or,more strictly, until after the output routine has been called.After the first box, rule, or insertion on the current pagethe \cs{vsize} is recorded in \cs{pagegoal},and its value is not looked at  until \cs{output}has been active.Changing \cs{pagegoal} does have an effect on the currentpage.When the page is empty,the pagegoal is \cs{maxdimen}, and \cs{pagetotal} is zero.Accumulated dimensions and stretch are available inthe parameters \cs{pagetotal}, \cs{pagedepth}, \cs{pagestretch}, \cs{pagefilstretch}, \cs{pagefillstretch}, \cs{pageshrink},and \cs{pagefilllstretch}.\csterm pagetotal\par\csterm pagedepth\par\csterm pagestretch\par\csterm pagefilstretch\par\csterm pagefillstretch\par\csterm pageshrink\par\csterm pagefilllstretch\parThey are set by the page builder. The stretch andshrink parameters are updated every time glue is addedto the page. The depth parameter becomes zeroif the last item was kern or glue.These parameters are \gr{special dimen}s; an assignmentto any of them is an \gr{intimate assignment},and it is automatically global.\point Breakpoints\spoint Possible breakpointsPage breaks can occur at the same kind of locations where\term breakpoints in vertical lists\parline breaks can occur:\itemlist\item at glue that is preceded by a non-discardableitem;\item at a kern that is immediately followed by glue;\item at a penalty.\itemliststop\TeX\ inserts interline glue and various sorts ofinterline penalties when the lines of a paragraph areadded to the vertical list, so there will usually be sufficient breakpoints on the page.\spoint Breakpoint penaltiesIf \TeX\ decides to break a page at a penalty item, thispenalty will, most of the time, be one thathas been inserted automaticallybetween the lines of a paragraph.If the last item on a list (not necessarily a vertical list)\altis a penalty, the value of this is recorded\csterm lastpenalty\parin the parameter \cs{lastpenalty}. If the item is other thana penalty, this parameter has the value zero.The last penalty of a list can be removed with the command\csterm unpenalty\par\cs{unpenalty}. See Section~\ref[varioset] for an example.\message{Spoint ref varioset}Here is a list of such penalties\term penalties in vertical mode\par:\invent\item interlinepenalty       \csterm interlinepenalty\par      Penalty for breaking a page between lines of a paragraph.       In plain \TeX\ this is zero, so no penalty is added in      between lines. \TeX\ can then find a valid breakpoint at the      \cs{baselineskip} glue.\item clubpenalty       \csterm clubpenalty\par      Extra penalty for breaking a page after the first line of a paragraph.       In plain \TeX\ this is~\n{150}.      This amount, and the following penalties, are       added to the \cs{interlinepenalty}, and      a penalty of the resulting size is inserted after the      \cs{hbox} containing the first line of a paragraph      instead of the \cs{interlinepenalty}.\item widowpenalty       \csterm widowpenalty\par      Extra penalty for breaking a page before the last line of a paragraph.       In plain \TeX\ this is~\n{150}.\item displaywidowpenalty       \csterm displaywidowpenalty\par      Extra penalty for breaking a page before the last line       above a display formula.

For instance,the plain format has macros to encourage (possibly, force)or prohibit page breaks\csterm penalty\par:\Ver>\def\break{\penalty-10000 }        % force break\def\nobreak{\penalty10000 }       % prohibit break\def\goodbreak{\par\penalty-500 }  % encourage page break<RevAlso, \ver>\vadjust{\penalty ... }> is a way of gettingpenalties in the vertical list. This can be used todiscourage or encourage page breaking after a certainline of a paragraph.\spoint Breakpoint computation\advance\rightskip by 5.5cmWhenever an item is moved to the current page, \TeX\\term page breaking\par\term breakpoints, computation of\par\vadjust{\advance\hsize by -5.5cm  \hbox to \hsize{\hfil\rlap{\hskip.4cm\vtop to 0pt  {\kern-2\baselineskip    \SansSerif \PointSize:8 \Style:roman   \parindent0pt \offinterlineskip   \def\tbox#1{\hbox{\quad\quad #1%               \vrule height 10pt depth3pt width0cm }}   \hbox   {\vrule width\lw \kern-\lw    \vbox{\hsize=5cm          \hrule height\lw \ \vskip0cm           \kern40pt           \tbox{underfull page}           \tbox{$b=10\,000$}           \kern40pt          \hrule height\lw           \kern8pt           \tbox{feasible breakpoints}           \tbox{$b<10\,000$}           \kern8pt          \hrule height\lw           \kern8pt           \tbox{overfull page}           \tbox{$b=\infty$}           \kern3pt           \tbox{.\vrule height3.5pt depth1pt width0cm}           \tbox{.\vrule height3.5pt depth1pt width0cm}           \tbox{.\vrule height3.5pt depth1pt width0cm}           \kern8pt           }%    \kern-\lw \vrule width\lw}%    \vss}}}}computes the penalty $p$ and the badness $b$ associated withbreaking the page at that place. From the penalty andthe badness the cost $c$ of breaking is computed.The place of least cost is remembered, and whenthe cost is infinite, that is, the page is overfull, orwhen the penalty is $p\leq-10\,000$, the current page is brokenat  the (last remembered) place of least cost. The broken-off piece is thenput in \cs{box255} and the output routine token listis inserted. Box 255 is always given a height of \cs{vsize},regardless of how much material it has.The badness calculation is based on the amount of stretchingor shrinking that is necessary to fit the page ina box with height \cs{vsize} and maximum depth \cs{maxdepth}. This calculation isthe same as for line breaking (see Chapter~\ref[glue]).Badness is a value $0\leq b\leq 10\,000$, except whenpages are overfull; then~$b=\infty$.\advance\rightskip by -5.5cmSome penalties are implicitly inserted by \TeX, for instance the \cs{interlinepenalty}which is put in between every pair of lines of a paragraph.Other penalties canbe explicitly inserted by the user or a user macro. A~penaltyvalue $p\geq10\,000$ inhibits breaking; a penalty$p\leq-10\,000$ (in external vertical mode)\altforces a page break, and immediatelyactivates the output routine. Cost calculation proceeds as follows:\enumerate \item When a penalty is so low that it forcesa page break and immediate invocation of the output routine, but the page is not overfull, that is\disp$b<\infty\quad\hbox{and}\quad p\leq-10\,000$\>the cost is equal to the penalty:~$c=p$.\item When penalties do not force anything, and the page is notoverfull, that is\disp$b<\infty\quad\hbox{and}\quad |p|<10\,000$\dispstopthe cost is~$c=b+p$.\item For pages that are very bad, that is\disp$b=10\,000\quad\hbox{and}\quad |p|<10\,000$\dispstopthe cost is~$c=10\,000$.\item An overfull page, that is\disp$b=\infty\quad\hbox{and}\quad p<10\,000$\dispstopgives infinite cost:~$c=\infty$.In this case \TeX\ decides that the optimal break pointmust have occurred earlier, and it invokes the output routine.Values of \cs{insertpenalties} (see Chapter~\ref[insert])that exceed $10\,000$also give infinite cost.\enumeratestopThe fact that a penalty $p\leq-10\,000$ activatesthe output routine is used extensivelyin the \LaTeX\ output routine: the excess $\mathopen|p\mathclose|-10\,000$ isa code indicating the reason for calling the output routine;see also the second example in the next chapter.\point[vsplit] \cs{\vsplit}The page-breaking operation is available to the user\csterm vsplit\parthrough the \cs{vsplit} operation.\example \Ver>\setbox1 = \vsplit2 to \dimen3<Revassigns to box~1 the top part of size \cs{dimen3}of box~2. This material is actually removed from box~2.Compare this with splitting off a chunk of size \cs{vsize}from the current page.\>The extractedresult of \disp\cs{vsplit}\gr{8-bit number}\n{to}\gr{dimen}\dispstop is a box with the following properties.\itemlist \item Height equal to the specified \gr{dimen}; \TeX\ will      go through the original box register (which must contain      a vertical box) to find the best breakpoint. This may      result in an underfull box.\item Depth at most \cs{splitmaxdepth}; this is analogous to      \csterm splitmaxdepth\par      the \cs{maxdepth} for the page box, rather than the \cs{boxmaxdepth}      that holds for any box.\item A first and last mark in the \cs{splitfirstmark} and       \cs{splitbotmark} registers.\itemliststopThe remainder of the \cs{vsplit} operation is a box where\itemlist \item all discardables have been removed      from the top;\item glue of size \cs{splittopskip} has been inserted on top;\csterm splittopskip\par      if the box being split was box~255, it      already had \cs{topskip} glue on top;\item its depth has been forced to be at most \cs{splitmaxdepth}.\>The bottom of the original box is always a valid breakpointfor the \cs{vsplit} operation. If this breakpoint is taken,the remainder box register is void. The extracted boxcan be empty; it is only void if the original boxwas void, or not a vertical box.Typically, the \cs{vsplit} operation is used to split off partof \cs{box255}. By setting \cs{splitmaxdepth} equal to \cs{boxmaxdepth}the result is something that could have been made by \TeX's pagebuilder. After pruning the top of \cs{box255}, the mark registers \cs{firstmark} and \cs{botmark} contain the firstand last marks on the remainder of box~255.See the next chapter for more information on marks.\point Examples of page breaking\spoint Filling up a pageSuppose a certain vertical box is too largeto fit on the remainder of the page.Then \Ver>\vfil\vbox{ ... }<Rev is the wrong wayto fill up the page and push the box to the next.\TeX\ can only break at the start of the glue, andthe \cs{vfil} is discarded after the break: the resultis an underfull, or at least horribly stretched, page.On the other hand,\Ver>\vfil\penalty0 % or any other value\vbox{ ... }<Rev is the correct way: \TeX\ will breakat the penalty, and the page will be filled.\spoint Determining the breakpointIn the following examples the \cs{vsplit} operation isused, which has the samemechanism as page breaking.Let the macros andparameter settings\Ver>\offinterlineskip \showboxdepth=1\def\High{\hbox{\vrule height5pt}}\def\HighAndDeep{\hbox{\vrule height2.5pt depth2.5pt}}<Revbe given.First let us consideran example where a vertical list is simply stretchedin order to reach a break point.\Ver>\splitmaxdepth=4pt \setbox1=\vbox{\High \vfil \HighAndDeep}\setbox2=\vsplit1 to 9pt<Revgives \Ver>> \box2=\vbox(9.0+2.5)x0.4, glue set 1.5fil.\hbox(5.0+0.0)x0.4 [].\glue 0.0 plus 1.0fil.\glue(\lineskip) 0.0.\hbox(2.5+2.5)x0.4 []<RevThe two boxes together have a height of \n{7.5pt},so the glue has to stretch~\n{1.5pt}.Next, we decrease the allowed depth of the resulting list.\Ver>\splitmaxdepth=2pt \setbox1=\vbox{\High \vfil \HighAndDeep}\setbox2=\vsplit1 to 9pt<Rev gives\Ver>> \box2=\vbox(9.0+2.0)x0.4, glue set 1.0fil.\hbox(5.0+0.0)x0.4 [].\glue 0.0 plus 1.0fil.\glue(\lineskip) 0.0.\hbox(2.5+2.5)x0.4 []<RevThe reference point is moved down half a point,and the stretch is correspondingly diminished,\altbut this motion cannot lead to a larger dimensionthan was specified.As an example of this,\altconsider the sequence \Ver>\splitmaxdepth=3pt \setbox1=\vbox{\High \kern1.5pt \HighAndDeep}\setbox2=\vsplit1 to 9pt<RevThis gives a box exactly 9 points high and 2.5 points deep.Setting \ver>\splitmaxdepth=2pt> does not increasethe height by half a point; instead, an underfull boxresults because an earlier break is taken.Sometimes the timing of actions is important.\TeX\ first locates a breakpoint that will leadto the requested height, then checks whether accommodatingthe \cs{maxdepth} or \cs{splitmaxdepth} will notviolate that height.Consider an example of this timing:\altin\Ver>\splitmaxdepth=4pt \setbox1=\vbox{\High \vfil \HighAndDeep}\setbox2=\vsplit1 to 7pt<Revthe result is {\italic not\/} a boxof 7 points high and 3 points deep.

The page builder cuts off a certain portionof the main vertical list and hands it to the output routinein \cs{box255}. This chapter treats the commands and parametersthat pertain to the output routine, and it explains howoutput routines can receive information through marks.\invent\item output       Token list with instructions for shipping out pages.\item shipout       Ship a box to the \n{dvi} file.\item mark       Specify a mark text.\item topmark       The last mark on the previous page.\item botmark       The last mark on the current page.\item firstmark       The first mark on the current page.\item splitbotmark       The last mark on a split-off page.\item splitfirstmark       The first mark on a split-off page.\item deadcycles       Counter that keeps track of how many times       the output routine has been called without a \cs{shipout}       taking place. \item maxdeadcycles       The maximum number of times that the output routine is allowed to      be called without a \cs{shipout} occurring.\item outputpenalty       Value of the penalty at the current page break, \alt      or $10\,000$ if the break was not at a penalty.\inventstop\point The \cs{\output} token listCommon parlance has it that`the output routine is called' when \TeX\ has found a placeto break the main vertical list.Actually, \cs{output} is not a macro but a token list thatis inserted into \TeX's command stream.Insertion of the \cs{output} token list happens\csterm output\par\term output routine\parinside a group that is implicitly opened.Also, \TeX\ enters internal vertical mode.Because of the group, non-local assignments (to the page number, for instance)have to be prefixed with \cs{global}.The vertical mode implies that during the workings of the output routine spaces are mostly harmless.The \cs{output} token list belongsto the class of the\gr{token parameter}s. These behave the same as\cs{toks}$nnn$ token lists; see Chapter~\ref[token].Assigning an output routine can therefore take the followingforms:\disp\cs{output}\gr{equals}\gr{general text}\quador\quad \cs{output}\gr{equals}\gr{filler}\gr{token variable}\>\point[output255] Output and \cs{\box255}\TeX's page builder breaks the current page at the optimal point,and stores everything above that in \cs{box255};then, the \cs{output} tokens are inserted into the input stream.Any remaining material on the main vertical listis pushed back to the recent contributions. If the page is broken at a penalty,\altthat value is recorded in \cs{outputpenalty}, and a penalty of size $10\,000$ is placed on top of therecent contributions; otherwise, \cs{outputpenalty}is set to~$10\,000$.When the output routine is finished, \cs{box255} issupposed to be empty.If it is not, \TeX\ gives an error message.Usually, the output routine will take the pagebox,\csterm shipout\parappend a headline and/""or footline,maybe merge in some insertions such as footnotes,and ship the page to the \n{dvi} file:\Ver>\output={\setbox255=\vbox           {\someheadline             \vbox to \vsize{\unvbox255 \unvbox\footins}            \somefootline}         \shipout\box255}<RevWhen box 255 reaches the output routine, its height hasbeen set to \cs{vsize}.However, the material in it can have considerablysmaller height.Thus, the above output routine may lead to underfull boxes.This can be remedied with a \cs{vfil}.The output routine is under no obligation to\csterm deadcycles\pardo anything useful with \cs{box255}; it can empty it, orunbox it to let \TeX\ have another go at finding a pagebreak. The number of timesthat the output routing  postpones the \cs{shipout}is recorded in \cs{deadcycles}: this parameter is set to~0by \cs{shipout}, and increased by~1 just before every \cs{output}.When  the number of dead cycles reaches\csterm maxdeadcycles\par\cs{maxdeadcycles}, \TeX\ gives an error message,and performs the default output routine\Ver>\shipout\box255<Rev instead of the routine it was aboutto start.The \LaTeX\ format has a much higher value for \cs{maxdeadcycles}than plain \TeX, because the output routine in \LaTeX\is often called forintermediate handling of floats and marginal notes.The \cs{shipout} command can send any \gr{box} to the \n{dvi} file;this need not be box 255, or even a boxcontaining the current page.It does not have to be called inside the output routine, either.If the output routine produces any material, for instanceby calling \Ver>\unvbox255<Rev this is put on topof the recent contributions.After the output routine finishes, the page builder isactivated. In particular, because the current pagehas been emptied, the \cs{vsize} is read again.Changes made to this parameter inside the outputroutine (using \cs{global}) will therefore take effect.\point MarksInformation can be passed to the output routine through the\term marks\par\csterm mark\parmechanism of `marks'. The user can specify a token listwith \disp\cs{mark}\lb\gr{mark text}\rb\dispstopwhich is put in a mark item on the current vertical list.The mark text is subject to expansion as in \cs{edef}.If the mark is given in horizontal mode it migrates tothe surrounding vertical lists like an insertion item(see page~\pgref[migrate]);however, if this is not the external vertical list, theoutput routine will not find the mark.Marks are the main mechanism through which the output routinecan obtain information about the contents of the currentlybroken-off page, in particular its top and bottom.\TeX\ sets three variables:\description \item \cs{botmark}   the last mark occurring on the current page\csterm botmark\par;\item \cs{firstmark}   the first mark occurring on the current page\csterm firstmark\par;\item \cs{topmark}   the last mark of the previous page\csterm topmark\par,    that is, the value of \cs{botmark}   on the previous page.\descriptionstopIf no marks have occurred yet, all three are empty;if no marks occurred on the current page, all three mark variables are equalto the \cs{botmark} of the previous page.For boxes generated by a \cs{vsplit} command (see previous chapter),the \cs{splitbotmark} and \cs{splitfirstmark}\csterm splitbotmark\par\csterm splitfirstmark\parcontain the marks of the split-off part; \cs{firstmark}and \cs{botmark} reflect the state of what remains in the register.\example Marks can be used to get a section heading into\howto Do tricks with headlines\parthe headline or footline of the page.\Ver>\def\section#1{ ... \mark{#1} ... }\def\rightheadline{\hbox to \hsize   {\headlinefont \botmark\hfil\pagenumber}}\def\leftheadline{\hbox to \hsize   {\headlinefont \pagenumber\hfil\firstmark}}<RevThis places the title of the first section that starts on a left page in the left headline, and the title of the last sectionthat starts on the right page in the right headline.Placing the headlines on the page is the job of the output routine;see below.It is important that no page breaks can occur in between themark and the box that places the title:\Ver>\def\section#1{ ...    \penalty\beforesectionpenalty    \mark{#1}    \hbox{ ... #1 ...}    \nobreak    \vskip\aftersectionskip    \noindent}<Rev\>Let us consideranother example with headlines: often a page looks better ifthe headline is omitted on pages where a chapter starts.This can be implemented as follows:\Ver>\def\chapter#1{ ... \def\chtitle{#1}\mark{1}\mark{0} ... }\def\theheadline{\expandafter\ifx\firstmark1     \else \chapheadline \fi}<RevOnly on the page where a chapter starts will the mark be~1,and on all other pages a headline is placed.\point Assorted remarks\spoint Hazards in non-trivial output routinesIf the final call to the output routine does notperform a \cs{shipout}, \TeX\ will call the outputroutine endlessly, since a run will only stop if boththe vertical list is empty, and \cs{deadcycles}is zero. The output routine can set \cs{deadcycles}to zero to prevent this.\spoint Page numberingThe page number is not an intrinsic property of the output\term page numbering\parroutine; in plain \TeX\ it is  the value of \cs{count0}.The output routine is responsible for increasing thepage number when a shipout of a  page occurs.Apart from   \cs{count0}, counter registers~1--9 are also usedfor page identification: at shipout \TeX\ writes the valuesof these ten counters to the \n{dvi} file (see Chapter~\ref[TeXcomm]).Terminal and log file output display only the non-zero counters,and the zero counters for which a non-zero counter witha higher number exists, that is, if \cs{count0}${}=1$ and\cs{count3}${}=5$ are the only non-zero counters, thedisplayed list of counters is~\n{[1.0.0.5]}.\spoint Headlines and footlines in plain \TeX\Plain \TeX\ has token lists \cs{headline} and\cs{footline}; these are used in the macros\cs{makeheadline} and \cs{makefootline}.The page is shipped out as (more or less)\Ver>\vbox{\makeheadline\pagebody\makefootline}<RevBoth headline and footline are inserted inside a \cs{line}.For non-standard headers and footers it is easier toredefine the macros \cs{makeheadline} and \cs{makefootline}than to tinker with the token lists.\spoint Example: no widow linesSuppose that one does not want to allow widow lines,but pages have in general no stretch or shrink,for instance because they only contain plain text.A~solution would be to increase the page lengthby one line if a page turns out to be brokenat a widow line.\TeX's output routine can perform this sort oftrick: if the \cs{widowpenalty} is set tosome recognizable value, the output routinecan see by the \cs{outputpenalty} if a widowline occurred. In that case, the output routinecan temporarily increase the \cs{vsize}, andlet the page builder have another go atfinding a break point.Here is the skeleton of such an output routine.No headers or footers are provided for.\Ver>\newif\ifLargePage \widowpenalty=147\newdimen\oldvsize \oldvsize=\vsize\output={    \ifLargePage \shipout\box255           \global\LargePagefalse          \global\vsize=\oldvsize    \else \ifnum \outputpenalty=\widowpenalty             \global\LargePagetrue             \global\advance\vsize\baselineskip             \unvbox255 \penalty\outputpenalty          \else  \shipout\box255    \fi   \fi}<RevThe test \cs{ifLargePage} is set to true by theoutput routine if the \cs{outputpenalty}equals the \cs{widowpenalty}. The page boxis then \cs{unvbox}$\,$ed, so that the page builderwill tackle the same material once more.\spoint Example: no indentation top of pageSome  output routines can be classified\howto Prevent indentation on top of page\paras abuse of the output routine mechanism.The output routine in this section is a good example of this.It is imaginable that one wishes paragraphs not to indentif they start at the top of a page. (There are plenty of objectionsto this layout, but occasionally it is used.)This problem can be solved using the output routine toinvestigate whether the page is still empty and, if so,to give a signal that a paragraph should not indent.Note that we cannot use the fact herethat the page builder comes into play afterthe insertion of \cs{everypar}: even if we couldforce the output routine to be activated here,there is no way for it to remove the indentation box.The solution given here lets the \cs{everypar}terminate the paragraph immediatelywith \Ver>\par\penalty-\specialpenalty<Revwhich activates the output routine.Seeing whether the pagebox is empty (after removingthe empty line and any \cs{parskip} glue),the output routine then can set a switchsignalling whether the retry of the paragraphshould indent.There are some minor matters in the followingroutines, the sense of which is leftfor the reader to ponder.\Ver>\mathchardef\specialpenalty=10001\newif\ifPreventSwitch \newbox\testbox \topskip=10pt\everypar{\begingroup \par    \penalty-\specialpenalty    \everypar{\endgroup}\parskip0pt     \ifPreventSwitch \noindent \else \indent \fi    \global\PreventSwitchfalse    }\output{    \ifnum\outputpenalty=-\specialpenalty         \setbox\testbox\vbox{\unvbox255                   {\setbox0=\lastbox}\unskip}        \ifdim\ht\testbox=0pt \global\PreventSwitchtrue        \else \topskip=0pt \unvbox\testbox \fi    \else \shipout\box255 \global\advance\pageno1 \fi}<Rev\spoint More examples of output routinesA large number of examples of output routinescan be found in~\cite[Sal1] and~\cite[Sal2].\subject[insert] InsertionsInsertions are \TeX's way of handling floating information.\TeX's page builder calculates what insertions and how manyof them will fit on the page; these insertion items are thenplaced in insertion boxes which are to be handled by theoutput routine.\invent\item insert       Start an insertion item.\item newinsert       Allocate a new insertion class. \item insertpenalties       Total of penalties for split insertions.      Inside the output routine, the number of held-over insertions.\item floatingpenalty       Penalty added when an insertion is split.\item holdinginserts      (\TeX3 only)      If this is positive, insertions are not placed in their boxes       at output time.\item footins      Number of the footnote insertion class in plain \TeX.\item topins      Number of the top insertion class.\item topinsert      Plain \TeX\ macro to start a top insert.\item pageinsert      Plain \TeX\ macro to start an insert that will take      up a whole page.\item midinsert      Plain \TeX\ macro that places its argument if there is space,      and converts it into a top insert otherwise.\item endinsert      Plain \TeX\ macro to wind up an insertion item      that started with \cs{topinsert}, \cs{midinsert},      or \cs{pageinsert}.\inventstop\point Insertion itemsInsertions contain floating information.\term insertions\parHandling insertions is a strange interplay between theuser, \TeX's internal workings, and the output routine.First the user specifies an insertion, which isa certain amount of vertical material; then \TeX's page builder decides what insertions should goon the current page and puts these insertions in insertion boxes;finally, the output routine has to do something with these boxes.An insertion item looks like\csterm insert\par\disp\cs{insert}\gr{8-bit number}\lb\gr{vertical mode material}\rb\dispstop where the 8-bit number should not be~255,because \cs{box255} is used by \TeX\ for passing the page to the outputroutine.The braces around the vertical mode material in an insertionitem can be implicit; they imply a new level of grouping.The vertical mode material is processed in internalvertical mode.Values of \cs{splittopskip}, \cs{splitmaxdepth}, and \cs{floatingpenalty} are relevant for split insertions(see below); the values that are current just beforethe end of the group are used.Insertion items can appear in vertical mode, horizontalmode, and math mode. For the latter two modes they have tomigrate to the surrounding vertical list(see page~\pgref[migrate]).After an insertion item is put on  the vertical list thepage builder is exercised.\point Insertion class declarationIn the plain format the  number for a new insertion classis allocated by \cs{newinsert}:\csterm newinsert\par\Ver>\newinsert\myinsert % new insertion class<Revwhich uses \cs{chardef} to assign a number to the controlsequence.Insertion classes are allocated numbering from 254 downward.As box~255 is used for output, this allocation scheme leaves\cs{skip255}, \cs{dimen255}, and \cs{count255}free for scratch use.\point Insertion parametersFor each insertion class~$n$ four registers are allocated:\itemlist\item \cs{box}$\,n$ When the output routine is active this box contains the insertion items of class~$n$ that should be placed on the current page.\item \cs{dimen}$\,n$ This is the maximum space allotted for insertions of class~$n$ per page. If this amount would be exceeded \TeX\ will split insertions.\item \cs{skip}$\,n$ Glue of this size is added the first time an insertion item of class~$n$ is added to the current page. This is useful for such phenomena as a rule separating the footnotes from the text of the page.\item \cs{count}$\,n$ Each insertion item is a vertical list, so it has a certain height. However, the effective height, the amount of influence it has on the text height of the page, may differ from this real height. The value of \cs{count}$\,n$ is then 1000 times the factor by which the height should be multiplied to obtain the effective height.  Consider the following examples: \itemlist\item Marginal notes do not affect the text height, so the factor should be~0. \item Footnotes set in double column mode affect the page by half of their height: the count value should by~500. \item Conversely, footnotes set at page width underneath a page in double column mode affect both columns, so \ldash provided that the double column mode is implemented by applying \cs{vsplit} to a double-height column \rdash  the count value should be~2000.\itemliststop\itemliststop\point Moving insertion items from the contributions listThe most complicated issue with insertions is the algorithmthat adds insertion items to the main vertical list,and calculates breakpoints if necessary.\TeX\ never changes the \cs{vsize}, but it diminishes the\csterm pagegoal\par\cs{pagegoal} by the (effective) heights of the insertionitems that will appear before a page break. Thus the outputroutine will receive a \cs{box255} that has height \cs{pagegoal},not necessarily \cs{vsize}.\enumerate\item When the first insertion of a certain class $n$ occurs  on the current page \TeX\ has to account for the quantity  \cs{skip}$\,n$. This step is executed only if no earlier  insertion item of this class occurs on the vertical list  \ldash this includes insertions that were split \rdash  but \cs{box}$\,n$  need not be empty at this time.    If \cs{box}$\,n$ is not empty, its height plus depth is multiplied  by \cs{count}$\,n/1000$ and the result is subtracted  from \cs{pagegoal}. Then the \cs{pagegoal} is diminished  by the natural component of \cs{skip}$\,n$. Any stretch and  shrink of \cs{skip}$\,n$ are incorporated in \cs{pagestretch}  and \cs{pageshrink} respectively.\item If there is a split insertion of class $n$ on the page  \ldash this case and the previous step in the algorithm are  mutually exclusive \rdash  the \cs{floatingpenalty} is added to  \csterm floatingpenalty\par\csterm insertpenalties\par  \cs{insertpenalties}. A~split insertion is an insertion item  for which a breakpoint has been calculated as it will not  fit on the current page in its entirety. Thus the insertion  currently under consideration will certainly not wind up   on the current page.\item After the preliminary action of the two previous points  \TeX\ will place the actual insertion item on the main vertical  list, at the end of the current contributions.  First it will check whether the item will fit without being split.    There are two conditions to be checked:\itemlist\item  adding the insertion item (plus all previous insertions of that class)  to \cs{box}$\,n$ should not let  the height plus depth of that box exceed \cs{dimen}$\,n$, and  \item either the effective height of the insertion is negative, or  \cs{pagetotal} plus \cs{pagedepth} minus \cs{pageshrink}  plus the effective size of the insertion should be less than  \cs{pagegoal}.\itemliststop  If these conditions are satisfied, \cs{pagegoal} is diminished  by the effective size of the insertion item, that is,  by the height plus depth, multiplied by \cs{count}$n/1000$.\item Insertions that fail on one of the two conditions in the  previous step of the algorithm will be considered for splitting.  \TeX\ will calculate the size of the maximal portion to   be split off the insertion item, such that  \enumerate\item adding this portion  together with earlier insertions of this class to \cs{box}$\,n$  will not let the size of the box exceed \cs{dimen}$\,n$,  and \item the effective size of this portion,  added to \cs{pagetotal} plus \cs{pagedepth}, will not  exceed \cs{pagegoal}. Note that \cs{pageshrink} is not taken  into account this time, as it was in the previous step.  \>    Once this maximal size to be split off has been determined,  \TeX\ locates the least-cost breakpoint in the current   insertion item that will result in a box with a  height  that is equal to this maximal size. The penalty associated  with this breakpoint is added to \cs{insertpenalties},  and \cs{pagegoal} is diminished by the effective height plus  depth of the box to be split off the insertion item.\enumeratestop\point Insertions in the output routineWhen the output routine comes into action \ldash more precisely:when \TeX\ starts processing the tokens in the \cs{output}token list \rdash  all insertions that should be placed on thecurrent page have been put in their boxes, andit is the responsibility of the output routineto put them somewhere in the box that is going to be shipped out.\example The plain \TeX\ output routinehandles top inserts and footnotes by packaging the followingsequence:\Ver>\ifvoid\topins \else \unvbox\topins \fi\pagebody\ifvoid\footins \else \unvbox\footins \fi<RevUnboxing the insertion boxes makes the glue on various partsof the page stretch or shrink in a uniform manner.\>With \TeX3 the insertion mechanism has been extended slightly:\csterm holdinginserts\par\term \TeX\ version 3\parthe parameter \cs{holdinginserts} can be used to specify thatinsertions should not yet be placed in their boxes.This is very useful if the output routine wants torecalculate the \cs{vsize}, or if the output routineis called to do other intermediate calculations instead ofejecting a page.During the output routine the parameter\csterm insertpenalties\par\cs{insertpenalties} holds the number of insertion items thatare being held over for the next page.In the plain \TeX\ output routine this is used after thelast page:\Ver>\def\dosupereject{\ifnum\insertpenalties>0     % something is being held over  \line{}\kern-\topskip\nobreak\vfill\supereject\fi}<Rev\point Plain \TeX\ insertionsThe plain \TeX\ format has only two insertion classes:the footnotes and the top inserts.The macro \cs{pageinsert} generates\csterm pageinsert\partop inserts that are stretched to be exactly \cs{vsize} high.The \cs{midinsert} macro tests whether the vertical material\csterm midinsert\parspecified by the user fits on the page; if so, it is placedthere; if not, it is converted to a top insert.Footnotes are allowed to be split, but once one has beensplit no further footnotes should appear on the currentpage. This effect is attained by setting \Ver>\floatingpenalty=20000<Rev The \cs{floatingpenalty} is added to \cs{insertpenalties}if an insertion follows a split insertion of the same class. However, \cs{floatingpenalty}${}>10\,000$ has infinitecost, so \TeX\ will take an earlier breakpoint forsplitting off the page from the vertical list.Top inserts essentially contain only a vertical boxwhich holds whatever the user specified. Thus such an insertcannot be split. However, the \cs{endinsert} macro\csterm endinsert\parputs a \cs{penalty100} on top of the box, so theinsertion can be split with an empty part before the split.The effect is that the whole insertion is carried over tothe next page. As the \cs{floatingpenalty} for top insertsis zero, arbitrarily many of these inserts can be moved forwarduntil there is a page with sufficient space.Further examples of insertion macros can be foundin~\cite[Sal3].%\message{Maybe spaceleft example?}\endinput
