\subject[baseline] Baseline Distances\hbox{}\vfil\vfil\hbox{}Lines of text are in most cases not of equal height or depth.Therefore \TeX\ adds interline glue to keep baselines at a uniformdistance from one another. This chapter treats the computation of suchinterline glue.\invent\item baselineskip       The `ideal' baseline distance between neighbouring       boxes on a vertical list.

Actually,the \cs{baselineskip} is  a \gr{glue}, so line distances canstretch or shrink. However, the natural sizes,as well as the stretch and the shrink, are the samebetween all lines.When boxes, whether they are lines of a paragraph or explicit boxes,are appended to a vertical list, glue is added usually so that the depth of the preceding boxand the height of the current one add up to the \cs{baselineskip}.This has the effect of keeping the reference points of subsequent lines at regular intervals.\eject\disp\leavevmode\hbox{}\nl\figone\>However, this process can bring the bottom and top of twosubsequent boxes to be less than \cs{lineskiplimit} apart:\disp\leavevmode\figtwo\>In that case, \cs{lineskip} glue is added:\disp\leavevmode\figthree\>Note that this will usually increase the distancebetween the baselines of the boxes to more than the\cs{baselineskip}.The exact process is this:\itemlist\item if \cs{prevdepth} is \n{-1000pt} or less,no glue is added, otherwise\item \TeX\ calculates the distance between the bottom of the previous boxand the top of the current one as the natural width of the\cs{baselineskip} minus \cs{prev\-depth} (thedepth of the last box) and minus the height of the current box;\item if this distance is at least \cs{lineskiplimit}, \csterm lineskiplimit\parglue is added with the calculated distance as natural size,and with the stretch and shrink of the \cs{baselineskip},\item otherwise \cs{lineskip} glue is added\csterm lineskip\par.\item \cs{prevdepth} is set to the depth of thecurrent item.\itemliststopThere are two exceptional  situations:no interline glue is added before and after a rule,and the \cs{prevdepth} is not updated by an \cs{unvbox}or \cs{unvcopy} command. After a rule interline glueis prevented by a value of \n{-1000pt} of the \cs{prevdepth}.The above process is carried out, irrespective of what extraglue may have been inserted in between the boxes.Thus a skip in between boxes in vertical mode will notaffect the distance calculated from the baseline distances,and therefore also not the amount of baselineskip glue.The same holds for glue added with \cs{vadjust} insidea paragraph.\examples\Ver>\baselineskip=10pt \lineskiplimit=2pt \lineskip=2pt\setbox0=\vbox{\hbox{\vrule depth4pt}               \hbox{\vrule height 3pt}}\showbox0<Rev gives\Ver>\box0=\vbox(10.0+0.0)x0.4.\hbox(0.0+4.0)x0.4..\rule(*+4.0)x0.4.\glue(\baselineskip) 3.0.\hbox(3.0+0.0)x0.4..\rule(3.0+*)x0<Rev Bringing the boxes to within  \cs{lineskiplimit}of each other, that is\Ver>\setbox0\vbox{\hbox{\vrule depth4pt}              \hbox{\vrule height 5pt}}\showbox0<Rev gives\Ver>\box0=\vbox(11.0+0.0)x0.4.\hbox(0.0+4.0)x0.4..\rule(*+4.0)x0.4.\glue(\lineskip) 2.0.\hbox(5.0+0.0)x0.4..\rule(5.0+*)x0.4<Rev where \cs{lineskip} glue has been insertedinstead of the usual \cs{baselineskip} glue.\>The plain \TeX\ default values are\Ver>\lineskiplimit=0pt lineskip=1pt<Revso, when boxes start to touch each other, they aremoved one point apart.\point The perceived depth of boxesThe decision process for interline glue uses \cs{prevdepth}\csterm prevdepth\paras the perceived depth of the preceding box on the verticallist. The \cs{prevdepth} parameter can be used only invertical mode.The \cs{prevdepth} is set to the depth of boxes added to thevertical list, but it is not affected by \cs{unvbox}or \cs{unvcopy}. After an \cs{hrule} it is set to\n{-1000pt} to prevent interline glue before the next box.At the beginning of a vertical list \cs{prevdepth}is set to \n{-1000pt}, except in an \cs{halign}and \cs{noalign} code contained therein, where itis carried over from the surrounding list.At the end of the alignment the value of \cs{prevdepth}set by the last alignment row is carried to the outer list.In order to prevent interline glue just once, all thatis needed is to alter the \cs{prevdepth}.This is done in the macro \cs{nointerlineskip}:\csterm nointerlineskip\par\Ver>\def\nointerlineskip{\prevdepth=-1000pt}<RevThe \cs{offinterlineskip} macro is much more drastic:\csterm offinterlineskip\parit prevents {\sl all\/} interline glue from the momentof its call onwards, or, if it is used inside a paragraph,from the start of that paragraph.Its definition is\Ver>\baselineskip=-1000pt \lineskip=0pt \lineskiplimit\maxdimen<Revwhere the second line is the essential one: itcauses \TeX\ to add \cs{lineskip} glue (which is zero)always. Settings for \cs{baselineskip} do not matter any more then.The \cs{offinterlineskip} macro has an important applicationin alignments (see Chapter~\ref[align]).By setting \Ver>\lineskiplimit=-\maxdimen<Revyou can force \TeX\  to apply the \cs{baselineskip}always, regardless of whether this would bring boxes too closetogether or, indeed, if this would make them overlap.\point TerminologyIn hot metal typesetting, all letters of a particular fontwere on a `body' of the samesize. Thus every line of type had the same height and depth, andthe resulting distance between the baselines would be some suitablevalue for that type. If for some reason this distance shouldbe larger (see~\cite[White:line] for a discussion of this),strips of lead would be inserted. The extra distance wascalled the `leading' (pronounced `ledding').With phototypesetting, when the baseline distance was sometimescalled the `film transport', this terminology blurred, and theterm `leading' was also used for the baseline distance. Some of thisconfusion is also present in \TeX: the parameter \cs{baselineskip}specifies the baseline distance, but in the trace output(see the examples above) the glue inserted to make the baseline distance equal to \cs{baselineskip} is called\cs{baselineskip}.\point Additional remarksIn general, for documents longer than one page it is desirableto have the same baseline distance throughout. However,for one-page documents you may add stretchability to thebaselineskip, for instance if the text has to be flush bottom.Increasing the distance between just one pair of linescan be done with \cs{vadjust}. The argument of thiscommand is vertical material that\vadjust{\kern2pt}will be inserted in thevertical list right after the line where this command was given.The second line of this paragraph, for instance, contains the command \ver-\vadjust{\kern2pt}-.The amount of leading cannot be changed in the middle ofa paragraph, because the value for \cs{baselineskip}that is used is the one thatis current when the paragraph is finally broken andadded to the main vertical list. The same holdsfor the \cs{lineskip} and \cs{lineskiplimit}.The plain \TeX\ macro \cs{openup}\csterm openup\parincreases the \cs{baselineskip}, \cs{lineskip}, and\cs{lineskiplimit} by the amount of the argumentto the macro. In effect, this increases line distancesby this amount regardless of whether they are governedby \cs{baselineskip} or \cs{lineskip}.\endinput
