\subject[gramm] The Grammar of \TeXMany  chapters in this book contain pieces of thegrammar that defines the formal syntax of \TeX.In this chapter the structure of the rewriting rules of thegrammar is explained, and some key notions are presented.In \TeXbook\ a grammar appears in Chapters~24--27.An even more rigorous grammar of \TeX\ can be found in~\cite[Appelt].The grammar presented in this book is virtually identical to that of \TeXbook.\point NotationsBasic to the grammar are \description\item grammatical termsThese are enclosed in angle brackets:\disp\gr{term}\dispstop\item control sequencesThese are given in typewriter type with a backslash forthe escape character:\disp\cs{command}\dispstop\>Lastly there are \description\item keywordsAlso given in typewriter type\disp\n{keyword}\dispstopThis is a limited collection of words that have a specialmeaning for \TeX\ in certain contexts; see below.\descriptionstopThe three elements of the grammar are used in syntax rules:\disp\gr{snark} $\longrightarrow$ \n{boojum} $|$ \gr{empty}\dispstopThis rule says that the grammatical entity \gr{snark}is either the keyword \n{boojum}, or the grammaticalentity \gr{empty}.There are two other notational conventions.The first is that the double quoteis used to indicate hexadecimal (base~16) notation.For instance \ver>"ab56> stands for $10\times16^3+11\times16^2+5\times16^1+6\times16^0$. The second conventionis that subscripts are used to denote category codes.Thus \n{a}$_{12}$ denotes an `a' of category~12.\point[keywords] KeywordsA keyword is sequence of characters (or character tokens)\term keywords\parof any category code but~13 (active).Unlike the situation in control sequences, \TeX\ does not distinguish between lowercase and uppercase charactersin keywords. Uppercase characters in keywords are converted tolowercase by adding 32 to them; the \cs{lccode} and \cs{uccode}are not used here. Furthermore, any keyword can be preceded byoptional spaces.Thus both \n{true cm} and \n{truecm} are legal.By far the strangest example, however, is providedby the grammar rule\disp\gr{fil unit} $\longrightarrow$ \n{fil} $|$ \gr{fil unit}\n l\dispstop which implies that \hbox{\n{fil L l}} is alsoa legal \gr{fil dimen}. Strange errors can ensue from this;see page~\pgref[fil:l:l] for an example.Here is the full list of all keywords: \n{at}, \n{bp},\n{by}, \n{cc}, \n{cm}, \n{dd}, \n{depth}, \n{em}, \n{ex},\n{fil}, \n{height}, \n{in}, \n l, \n{minus}, \n{mm}, \n{mu},\n{pc}, \n{plus}, \n{pt}, \n{scaled}, \n{sp}, \n{spread},\n{to}, \n{true}, \n{width}.\point Specific grammatical termsSome grammatical terms appear in a lot of rules.One such term is \gr{optional spaces}. It is probably\term space, optional\parclear what is meant, but here is the formal definition:\disp\gr{optional spaces} $\longrightarrow$     \gr{empty} $|$ \gr{space token}\gr{optional spaces}     \dispstopwhich amounts to saying that \gr{optional spaces}is zero or more space tokens.Other terms may not be so immediately obvious.Below are some of them.\spoint \gr{equals}In assignments the equals sign is optional; therefore thereis a term\disp\gr{equals} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{optional spaces}     $|$ \gr{optional spaces}$=_{12}$\dispstopin \TeX's grammar.\commentOne assignment exists where the equals sign cannotbe left out: \Ver>\let\spacetoken= %assign a space<RevHere the space would have been skipped in \TeX's input processorif the equals sign had been left out.\endcomment\spoint \gr{filler}, \gr{general text}More obscure than the \gr{optional spaces} is the combinationof spaces and \cs{relax} tokens that is allowedin some places, for instance\Ver>\setbox0= \relax\box1<RevThe quantity involved is \disp\gr{filler} $\longrightarrow$ \gr{optional spaces}     $|$ \gr{filler}\cs{relax}\gr{optional spaces}\dispstopOne important occurrence of \gr{filler} is in\disp\gr{general text} $\longrightarrow$     \gr{filler}\lb\gr{balanced text}\gr{right brace}     \dispstopA \gr{general text} follows such control sequences as\cs{message}, \cs{uppercase}, or \cs{mark}. The braces aroundthe \gr{balanced text} are explained in the next point.\spoint \lb\rb\ and \gr{left brace}\gr{right brace}The \TeX\ grammar uses a perhaps somewhat unfortunateconvention for braces. First of all \disp\lb\ and \rb\dispstopstand for braces that are either explicit open/close groupcharacters, or control sequences defined by \cs{let},such as \Ver>\let\bgroup={ \let\egroup=}<RevThe grammatical terms \disp\gr{left brace} and \gr{right brace}\dispstop stand for explicit open/close group characters,that is, characters of categories 1 and~2 respectively.Various combinations of these two kinds of braces exist.Braces around boxes can be implicit:\disp\cs{hbox}\gr{box specification}\lb     \gr{horizontal mode material}\rb\dispstopAround a macro definition there must be explicit braces:\disp\gr{definition text} $\longrightarrow$     \gr{parameter text}\gr{left brace}\gr{balanced text}\gr{right brace}     \dispstopFinally, the \gr{general text} that was mentioned abovehas to be explicitly closed, but it can be implicitly opened:\disp\gr{general text} $\longrightarrow$     \gr{filler}\lb\gr{balanced text}\gr{right brace}     \dispstopThe closing brace of a \gr{general text} has to be explicit,since a general text is a token list, which maycontain \cs{egroup} tokens.\TeX\ performs expansion to find the opening brace of a \gr{general text}.\spoint \gr{math field}In math mode various operations such as subscriptingor applying \cs{underline} take an argument thatis a \gr{math field}: either a single symbol, ora group. Here is the exact definition.\disp\gr{math field} $\longrightarrow$    \gr{math symbol} $|$ \gr{filler}\lb\gr{math mode material}\rb\nl \gr{math symbol}  $\longrightarrow$ \gr{character} $|$    \gr{math character}    \>See page~\pgref[character] for \gr{character},\altand page~\pgref[math:character] for \gr{math character}.\point[2vs3] Differences between \TeX\ versions 2 and 3In 1989 Knuth released \TeX\ version~3.0, which is \term \protect\TeX\ version 2\parthe first real change in \TeX\ since version~2.0,which was released in~1986 (version~0 of \TeX\ wasreleased in 1982; see~\cite[K:error] for more aboutthe history of \TeX).All intermediate versions were merely bug fixes.The main difference between versions 2~and~3 liesin the fact that 8-bit input has become possible.Associated with this, various quantities thatused to be 127 or~128 have been raised to 255or~256 respectively. Here is a short list.The full description is in~\cite[K:TeX23].\itemlist\message{Remove other TeX3 refernces!}\item All `codes' (\cs{catcode}, \cs{sfcode}, et cetera;    see page~\pgref[codename])    now apply to 256 character codes instead of~128.\item A character with code \cs{endlinechar}    is appended to the line unless this parameter is negativeor more than~255 (this was~127) (see page~\pgref[append:elc]).\item No escape character is output by \cs{write} and    other commands if \cs{escapechar} is negative or more than~255(this was~127) (see page~\pgref[use:escape]).\item The \ver>^^> replacement mechanism has been extended    (see page~\pgref[hathat]).\item Parameters \cs{language}, \cs{inputlineno},    \cs{errorcontextlines}, \cs{lefthyphenmin}, \cs{righthyphenmin},\cs{badness}, \cs{holdinginserts}, \cs{emergencystretch},and commands \cs{noboundary}, \cs{setlanguage}have been added.\item The value of \cs{outputpenalty} is no longer zero \alt    if the page break was not at a penalty item;    instead it is~$10\,000$ (see page~\pgref[break:penalty]).\>The plain format has also been updated, mostly\altwith default settings for parameters such as\cs{lefthyphenmin}, but also a few macros have been added.\endinput
