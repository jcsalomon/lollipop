Font dimension7 is called the `extra space'; see below (the listof all the font dimensions appears on page~\pgref[font:dims]). Ordinarily all spaces between words (in one font) would be ofequal size. To allow for differently sized spaces \ldash for instancea typeset equivalent of the double spacing afterpunctuation in typewritten documents \rdash\term space factor\par\TeX\ associates with each character a so-called `space factor'.When a character is added to the currenthorizontal list, the current value of the space factor(\cs{spacefactor}) becomes the space factor code (\cs{sfcode})\csterm spacefactor\parof that character, except that when that code is zero, thespace factor does not change. Also, when the space factor code of the last character is${>}1000$ and the current space factor is ${<}1000$, the space factorbecomes~1000.The maximum space factor  is~$32\,767$.The stretch component of the interword space ismultiplied by the space factor divided by 1000;the shrink component is divided by this factor. The extra space (font dimension~7) isadded to the natural component of theinterword space when the space factor is~${}\geq2000$.\point User interword spaceThe user can override the interword space contained in\csterm spaceskip\par\csterm xspaceskip\parthe \cs{fontdimen} parametersby setting the\cs{spaceskip} and the \cs{xspaceskip} to non-zero values.If \cs{spaceskip} is non-zero, it is taken insteadof the normal interword space(\cs{fontdimen2} plus \cs{fontdimen3} minus \cs{fontdimen4}), buta non-zero \cs{xspaceskip} is used as interword space ifthe space factor is~${}\geq2000$.If the \cs{spaceskip} is used,its stretch and shrink components aremultiplied and divided respectively by \cs{spacefactor}$/1000$.Note that, if \cs{spaceskip} and \cs{xspaceskip} aredefined in terms of \n{em}, they change with the font.\example Let the following macros be given:\Ver>\def\a.{\vrule height10pt width4pt\spacefactor=1000\relax}\def\b.{\vrule height10pt width4pt\spacefactor=3000\relax}\def\c{\vrule height10pt width4pt\relax}<Rev     then\disp\leavevmode\PopIndentLevel\hbox{$\vcenter{\snugbox{\Ver>\vbox{\fontdimen2\font=4pt % normal space \fontdimen7\font=3pt % extra space\a. \b. \c\par% zero extra space\fontdimen7\font=0pt\a. \b. \c\par% set \spaceskip for normal space\spaceskip=2\fontdimen2\font\a. \b. \c\par% set \xspaceskip\xspaceskip=2pt\a. \b. \c\par}<Rev}}$\quad gives\quad\message{Check snug and drop!}%$\vcenter{\snugbox{\parindent0pt\parskip=0pt\def\a.{\vrule height10pt width4pt\spacefactor=1000\relax}\def\b.{\vrule height10pt width4pt\spacefactor=3000\relax}\def\c{\vrule height10pt width4pt\relax}\leavevmode\strut\par\hbox{}\hbox{}% set the normal space and extra space\fontdimen2\font=4pt \fontdimen7\font=3pt\a. \b. \c\par \vskip2\baselineskip% zero extra space\fontdimen7\font=0pt\a. \b. \c\par \vskip2\baselineskip% set \spaceskip for normal space\spaceskip=2\fontdimen2\font\a. \b. \c\par \vskip2\baselineskip% set \xspaceskip\xspaceskip=2pt\a. \b. \c\par \leavevmode\strut}}$}\>In all of these lines the glue is set at natural width. In the firstline the high space factor value after \cs{b} causes the extraspace \cs{fontdimen7} to be added. If this is zero (second line), theonly difference between space factor values is the stretch/shrinkratio. In the third line the \cs{spaceskip} is takenfor all space factor values. If the \cs{xspaceskip} is nonzero,it is taken (fourth line) instead of the \cs{spaceskip}for the high value of the space factor.\>\point[tie] Control space and tieControl space, \csc{\char32}, is a horizontal commandwhich inserts a space, \term control space\par\csterm \char32\paracting as if the current space factor is~1000.It can therefore be used after abbreviations when \cs{nonfrenchspacing}(see below) is in effect. For example:\Ver>\hbox spread 9pt{\nonfrenchspacing      The Reverend Dr. Drofnats}<Revgives\disp \hbadness=10000 \leavevmode\hbox spread 9pt{\nonfrenchspacing      The Reverend Dr. Drofnats}\dispstopwhile\Ver>\hbox spread 9pt{\nonfrenchspacing      The Reverend Dr.\ Drofnats}<Revgives\disp \hbadness=10000 \leavevmode\hbox spread 9pt{\nonfrenchspacing      The Reverend Dr.\ Drofnats}\dispstopThe \n{spread 9pt} is used to make the effect more visible.The active character (in the plain format) tilde,~\n{\char126},\term tie\par\term \char126\paruses control space: it is defined as\Ver>\catcode`\~=\active\def~{\penalty10000\ }<RevSuch an active tilde is called a `tie'; it inserts an ordinary amount of space, and prohibits breaking at this space.\point More on the space factor\spoint Space factor assignmentsThe space factor of a particular character can be assigned as\term  spacefactor code\par\csterm sfcode\par\disp\cs{sfcode}\gr{8-bit number}\gr{equals}\gr{number}\dispstop\IniTeX\ assigns a space factor code of 1000 to all characters\label[ini:sf]%except uppercase characters; they get a space factor code of~999.The plain format then assigns space factor codes greater than1000 to various punctuation symbols, for instance\ver-\sfcode`\.=3000-, which triples the stretch and shrinkafter a full stop. Also, for all space factor values $\geq2000$the extra space is added; see above.\spoint PunctuationBecause the space factor cannot jump from a value below 1000to one above, a punctuation symbol after an uppercasecharacter will not have the effect on the interword spacethat punctuation after a lowercase character has.\example\Ver>a% \sfcode`a=1000, space factor becomes 1000.% \sfcode`.=3000, spacefactor becomes 3000 % subsequent spaces will be increased.A% \sfcode`A=999,  space factor becomes 999.% \sfcode`.=3000, space factor becomes 1000 % subsequent spaces will not be increased.<Rev\>Thus, initialsare not mistaken for sentence ends.If an uppercase character does end a sentence, for instance\Ver>... and NASA.<Rev there are several solutions:\Ver>... NASA\spacefactor=1000.<Rev or\Ver>... NASA\hbox{}.<Rev which abuses the fact that aftera box the space factor is set to~1000.The \LaTeX\ macro \cs{@} is equivalent to the firstpossibility.In the plain format two macros are defined that switch between\term frenchspacing\par\csterm frenchspacing\par\csterm nonfrenchspacing\paruniform interword spacing and extra space after punctuation.The macro \cs{frenchspacing} sets the space factor codeof all punctuation to~1000; the macro \cs{nonfrenchspacing}sets it to values greater than~1000.Here are the actual definitions from \n{plain.tex}:\Ver>\def\frenchspacing{\sfcode`\.\@m \sfcode`\?\@m   \sfcode`\!\@m \sfcode`\:\@m   \sfcode`\;\@m \sfcode`\,\@m}\def\nonfrenchspacing{\sfcode`\.3000 \sfcode`\?3000  \sfcode`\!3000 \sfcode`\:2000  \sfcode`\;1500 \sfcode`\,1250 }<Revwhere \Ver>\mathchardef\@m=1000<Rev is given in the plain format.French spacing is a somewhat controversial issue:\TeXbook\ acts as if non-French spacingis standard practice in printing, but for instance in~\cite[Hart]one finds `The space of the line should be used afterall points in normal text'.Extra space after punctuation may be considered a `typewriter habit', but this isnot entirely true. It used to be a lot more commonthan it is nowadays, and there are rational argumentsagainst it: the full stop (point, period) at the end of asentence, where extra punctuation is most visible, is rather small, so it carries some extra visual space  of its own above it. This book does not use extra spaceafter punctuation.\spoint Other non-lettersThe zero value of the space factor code makescharacters that are not a letter and not punctuation`transparent' for the space factor.\message{check break after Example}\example\Ver>a% \sfcode`a=1000, space factor becomes 1000.% \sfcode`.=3000, spacefactor becomes 3000 % subsequent spaces will be increased.a% \sfcode`a=1000, space factor becomes 1000.% \sfcode`.=3000, space factor becomes 3000)% \sfcode`)=0,    space factor stays 3000 % subsequent spaces will be increased.<Rev\>\spoint Other influences on the space factorThe space factor is 1000 when \TeX\ starts forming ahorizontal list, in particular after \cs{indent}, \cs{noindent},and directly after a display. It is also 1000 aftera \cs{vrule}, an accent, or a \gr{box} (in horizontal mode), butit is not influenced by \cs{unhbox} or \cs{unhcopy}commands.In the first column of a \cs{valign} the space factor ofthe surrounding horizontal list is carried over; similarly,after a vertical alignment the space factor is set to thevalue reached in the last column.\endinput
