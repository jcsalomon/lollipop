\subject[par:start] Paragraph StartAt the start of a paragraph \TeX\ inserts a vertical skipas a separation from the preceding paragraph, and a horizontalskip as an indentation for the current paragraph.This chapter explains the exact sequenceof actions,and it discusses how \TeX's decisions can be altered.\invent\item indent       Switch to horizontal mode and insert a box of width \cs{parindent}.\item noindent        Switch to horizontal mode with an empty horizontal list.\item parskip       Amount of glue added to       the surrounding vertical list when a paragraph starts.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{0pt plus 1pt}.\item parindent        Size of the indentation box added in front of a paragraph.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{20pt}.\item everypar       Token list inserted in front of paragraph text; \item leavevmode       Macro to switch to horizontal mode if necessary.\inventstop\point When does a paragraph start\TeX\ starts a paragraph whenever it switches from vertical mode to (unrestricted) horizontal mode. This switch canbe effected by one of the commands\cs{indent} and \cs{noindent}, for example\Ver>{\bf And now~\dots}\vskip3pt\noindent It's~\dots<Revor by any \gram{horizontal command}.Horizontal commands include characters, in-line formulas,and horizontal skips, but not boxes.Consider the following examples.\altThe character `I' is a horizontal command:\Ver>\vskip3ptIt's~\dots<Rev A single \n\$ is a horizontal command:\Ver>$x$ is supposed~\dots<Rev The control sequence \cs{hskip} is a horizontal command:\Ver>\hskip .5\hsize Long indentation~\dots<RevThe full list of horizontal commands is given onpage~\pgref[h:com:list].Upon recognizing a horizontal command in vertical mode,\TeX\ will perform an \cs{indent} command (and all the actionsassociated with it; see below), and after that it will reexamine the horizontal command,this time executing it.\point What happens when a paragraph startsThe \cs{indent} and \cs{noindent}  commands \term paragraph start\par\csterm indent\par\csterm noindent\parcause a paragraph to be started.An~\cs{indent} command can either be placed explicitly bythe user or a macro, or it can be inserted by \TeX\ whena \gr{horizontal command} occurs in vertical mode;a~\cs{noindent} command can only be placed explicitly.After  either command is encountered,\cs{parskip} glue is appended to the surrounding verticallist\csterm parskip\par,unless \TeX\ is in internal vertical mode and that list is empty(for example, at the start of a \cs{vbox} or \cs{vtop}).\TeX\ then switches to unrestricted horizontal modewith an empty horizontal list.In the case of \cs{indent} (which may be insertedimplicitly) an empty \cs{hbox} of width\csterm parindent\par\cs{parindent} is placed at the start of the horizontal list; after \cs{noindent} no indentationbox is inserted. The contents of the \cs{everypar} \gr{token parameter}\csterm everypar\parare then inserted into the input (see some applications below).After that,the page builder is exercised (see Chapter~\ref[page:break]).Note that this happens in horizontal mode: this is to move the \cs{parskip} glue to the current page.If an \cs{indent} command is given while \TeX\ is already inhorizontal mode, the indentation box is inserted just the same.This is not very useful.\point Assorted remarks\spoint Starting a paragraph with a boxAn \cs{hbox} does not imply horizontal mode, so an attempt to start a paragraph with a box, for instance\Ver>\hbox to 0cm{\hss$\bullet$\hskip1em}Text ....<Revwill make the text following the boxwind up one line below the box.It is necessary to switch to horizontal modeexplicitly, using for instance \cs{noindent} or\cs{leavevmode}. The latter is defined using \cs{unhbox},which is a horizontal command.\spoint Starting a paragraph with a groupIf the first \gram{horizontal command} of a paragraphis enclosed in braces, the \cs{everypar} is evaluatedinside the group. This may give unexpected results.Consider this example:\Ver>\everypar={\setbox0=\vbox\bgroup\def\par{\egroup}}{\bf Start} a paragraph ... \par<RevThe \gr{horizontal command} starting the paragraph is thecharacter~`S', so when \cs{everypar} has been insertedthe input is essentially\Ver>{\bf \indent\setbox0=\vbox\bgroup    \def\par{\egroup}Start} a paragraph ... \par<Revwhich is equivalent to\Ver>{\bf \setbox0=\vbox{Start} a paragraph ... \par<RevThe effect of this is rather different from what was intended.\altAlso, \TeX\ will probably end the job inside a group.\point Examples\spoint Stretchable indentation Considering that \cs{parindent} is a \gram{dimen}, not a \gram{glue},it is not possible to declare\Ver>\parindent=1cm plus 1fil<Rev in order to geta variable indentation at the start of a paragraph.This problem may be solved by putting\Ver>\everypar={\nobreak\hskip 1cm plus 1fil\relax}<RevThe \cs{nobreak} serves to prevent (in rare cases) a line breakat the stretchable glue.\spoint Suppressing indentationInserting \ver.{\setbox0=\lastbox}. in the horizontal listat the beginning of the paragraphremoves the indentation:indentation consists of a box, which is available through\cs{lastbox}. Assigning it effectively removes it from the list.However, this command sequencehas to be inserted at a moment when \TeX\ hasalready switched to horizontal mode, so explicit insertionof these commands in front of the first \gram{horizontalcommand} of the paragraph does not work. The moment of insertion of the \cs{everypar} tokens is a better candidate: specifying\Ver>\everypar={{\setbox0=\lastbox}}<Revleads to unindented paragraphs, even if \cs{parindent} is not zero. \spoint[indent:scheme] An indentation schemeThe above idea of letting the indentation box be removed\howto Control indentation systematically\parby \cs{everypar} can be put to use in a systematic approachto indentation, where two conditionals\Ver>\newif\ifNeedIndent %as a rule\newif\ifneedindent %special cases<Revcontrol whether paragraphs should indent as a rule, andwhether in special cases indentation is needed.This section is taken from~\cite[E3].We take a fixed \cs{everypar}:\Ver>\everypar={\ControlledIndentation}<Revwhich executes in some cases the macro \cs{RemoveIndentation}\Ver>\def\RemoveIndentation{{\setbox0=\lastbox}}<RevThe implementation of \cs{ControlledIndentation} is:\Ver>\def\ControlledIndentation   {\ifNeedIndent \ifneedindent                   \else \RemoveIndentation\needindenttrue \fi    \else \ifneedindent \needindentfalse          \else         \RemoveIndentation    \fi   \fi}<RevIn order to regulate indentation for a whole document,the user now once specifies, for instance,\Ver>\NeedIndenttrue<Rev to indicate that, in principle,all paragraphs should indent.Macros such as \cs{section} can then preventindentation in individual cases:\Ver>\def\section#1{ ... \needindentfalse}<Rev    \spoint[skip:scheme] A paragraph skip schemeThe use of \cs{everypar} to control indentation,\howto Control vertical white space systematically\paras was sketched above, can be extended to theparagraph skip.A visible white space between paragraphs can becreated by the \cs{parskip} parameter, but, once thisparameter has been set to some value, it is difficultto prevent paragraph skip in certain places elegantly.Usually, white space above and below environmentsand section headings should be specifiable independentlyof the paragraph skip. This section sketches anapproach where \cs{parskip} is set to zero directlyabove and below certain constructs, while the \cs{everypar}is used to restore former values. This section istaken from~\cite[E4].First of all, here are two tools. The control sequence\cs{csarg} will be used only inside other macros;a typical call will look like\Ver>\csarg\vskip{#1Parskip}<RevHere is the definition:\Ver>\def\csarg#1#2{\expandafter#1\csname#2\endcsname}<RevNext follows a generalization of \cs{vskip}: the macro\cs{vspace} will not place its argument if the previous glue itemis larger; otherwise it will eliminate the precedingglue, and place its argument.\Ver>\newskip\tempskipa\def\vspace#1{\tempskipa=#1\relax    \ifvmode \ifdim\tempskipa<\lastskip              \else \vskip-\lastskip \vskip\tempskipa \fi    \else    \vskip\tempskipa \fi}<Rev    Now assume that any construct \n{foo} with surrounding white spacestarts and ends with macro calls \ver>\StartEnvironment{foo}> and\ver>\EndEnvironment{foo}> respectively.Furthermore, assume that to this environment there correspondthree glue registers:the \cs{fooStartskip} (glueabove the environment), \cs{fooParskip} (the paragraph skipinside the environment), and the \cs{fooEndskip} (glue belowthe environment).For restoring the value of the paragraph skipa conditional and a glue register are needed:\Ver>\newskip\TempParskip \newif\ifParskipNeedsRestoring<RevThe basic sequence for thestarting and ending macros for the environments is then\Ver>\TempParskip=\parskip\parskip=0cm\relax\ParskipNeedsRestoringtrue<RevThe implementations can now be given as:\Ver>\def\StartEnvironment#1{\csarg\vspace{#1Startskip}    \begingroup % make changes local    \csarg\TempParskip{#1Parskip} \parskip=0cm\relax    \ParskipNeedsRestoringtrue}\def\EndEnvironment#1{\csarg\vspace{#1Endskip}    \endgroup % restore global values    \ifParskipNeedsRestoring    \else \TempParskip=\parskip \parskip=0cm\relax          \ParskipNeedsRestoringtrue    \fi}<RevThe \cs{EndEnvironment} macro needs a little comment:if an environment is used inside another one, andit occurs before the first paragraph in that environment,the value of the paragraph skip for the outer environmenthas already been saved. Therefore no further actions arerequired in that case.Note that both macros start with a vertical skip. This preventsthe \cs{begingroup} and \cs{endgroup} statements fromoccurring in a paragraph. We now come to the main point: if necessary, the\cs{everypar} will restore the value of the paragraph skip.\Ver>\everypar={\ControlledIndentation\ControlledParskip}\def\ControlledParskip   {\ifParskipNeedsRestoring       \parskip=\TempParskip \ParskipNeedsRestoringfalse    \fi}<Rev\subject[par:end]  Paragraph End\TeX's mechanism for ending a paragraph is ingenious and effective.This chapter explains the mechanism, the role of \cs{par} in it,and it gives a number of practical remarks.\invent\item par       Finish off a paragraph and go into vertical mode.\item endgraf      Synonym for \cs{par}: \ver>\let\endgraf=\par>\item parfillskip       Glue that is placed between the last                element of the paragraph and the line end.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{0pt plus 1fil}.\inventstop\point The way paragraphs endA paragraph is terminated by the primitive \cs{par} command, \term paragraph end\parwhich canbe explicitly typed by the user (or inserted bya macro expansion):\Ver>... last words.\parA new paragraph ...<RevIt can be implicitly generated in the input processor of \TeX\by an empty line (see Chapter~\ref[mouth]):\Ver>... last words.A new paragraph ...<Rev The \cs{par} can be inserted because a \gr{vertical command}occurred in unrestricted horizontal mode:\Ver>... last words.\vskip6ptA new paragraph ...<RevAlso, a paragraph ends if a closing brace is foundin horizontal mode inside \cs{vbox}, \cs{insert}, or \cs{output}.After the \cs{par} command \TeX\ goes into vertical modeand exercises the page builder (see page~\pgref[par:page:build]).If the \cs{par} was inserted because a vertical command occurred inhorizontal mode, the vertical command is then examined anew.The \cs{par} does not insert any verticalglue or penalties itself. A~\cs{par} command also clearsthe paragraph shape parameters (see Chapter~\ref[par:shape]).\spoint The \cs{par} command and the \cs{par} tokenIt is important to distinguish between the \cs{par} tokenand the primitive \cs{par} command that is the initial meaning ofthat token. The \cs{par} token is inserted when the inputprocessor sees an emptyline, or when the execution processor finds a \gram{vertical command}in horizontal mode;the \cs{par} command is what actually closes off a paragraph.Decoupling the token and the command is an important toolfor special effects in paragraphs (see some examples inChapters \ref[boxes] and~\ref[rules]).\spoint Paragraph filling: \cs{parfillskip}After the last element of the paragraph \TeX\ implicitly insertsthe equivalent of\csterm parfillskip\par\Ver>\unskip \penalty10000 \hskip\parfillskip<RevThe \cs{unskip} serves to remove any spurious glue at theparagraph end, such as the space generated by theline end if the \cs{par} was inserted by the input processor.For example:\message{check unsplit paragraph example}\Ver>end.\noindent Begin<Rev results in the tokens\disp\n{end.\char32}\cs{par} \n{Begin}\>With the sequence inserted by the \cs{par} this becomes\disp\n{end.\char32}\ver>\unskip\penalty10000\hskip ...>\>which in turn gives\disp\ver>end.\penalty ...>\>The \cs{parfillskip} is in plain \TeX\ first-order infinite(\n{0pt plus 1fil}),so ending a paragraph with \ver.\hfil$\bullet$\par.will give a bullet halfway between the last word and theline end; with \ver.\hfill$\bullet$\par. it will beflush right.\point Assorted remarks\spoint Ending a paragraph and a group at the same timeIf a paragraph is set in a group, it may be necessary to ensure that the \cs{par} endingthe paragraph occurs inside the group.The parameters influencing the typesetting of the paragraph,such as the \cs{leftskip} and the \cs{baselineskip},are only looked at when the paragraph is finished.Thus finishing off a paragraph with \Ver>... last words.}\par<Rev causes the values to be usedthat prevail outside the group, instead of those inside.Better ways to end the paragraph are\Ver>... last words.\par}<Rev or\Ver>... last words.\medskip}<RevIn the second example the vertical command \cs{medskip}causes the \cs{par} token to be inserted.\spoint Ending a paragraph with \cs{hfill}\cs{break}The sequence \ver.\hfill\break. is a way to forcea `newline' inside a paragraph. If you end a paragraphwith this, however, you will probablyget an \ver-Underfull \hbox- error.Surprisingly, the underfull box is not the broken line\ldash after all, that one was filled \rdash but a completely empty box following it (actually, itdoes contain the \cs{leftskip} and \cs{rightskip}). What happens?The paragraph ends with \Ver>\hfill\break\par<Revwhich turns into \Ver>\hfill\break\unskip\nobreak\hskip\parfillskip<RevThe \cs{unskip} finds no preceding glue, so the \cs{break}is followed by a penalty item and a glue item, both ofwhich disappear after the line break has been chosen at the\cs{break}.However, \TeX\ has already decided that there should be an extraline, that is, an \ver.\hbox to \hsize.. And there is nothing\altto fill it with, so an underfull box results.\spoint Ending a paragraph with a ruleSee page~\pgref[par:leaders:end] for paragraphs ending with rule leaders instead of the default \cs{parfillskip}white space.\spoint No page breaks in between paragraphsThe \cs{par} command does not insert any glue in the\howto Prevent page breaks in between paragraphs\parvertical list, soin the sequence\Ver> ... last words.\par \nobreak \medskip \noindent First words ...<Revno page breaks will occur  between the paragraphs.The vertical list generated is\Ver>\hbox(6.94444+0.0)x ...       % last line of paragraph\penalty 10000                % \nobreak\glue 6.0 plus 2.0 minus 2.0  % \medskip\glue(\parskip) 0.0 plus 1.0  % \parskip\glue(\baselineskip) 5.05556  % interline glue\hbox(6.94444+0.0)x ...       % first line of paragraph<Rev\TeX\ will not break this vertical list above the \cs{medskip},because the penalty value prohibits it; it will not breakat any other place, because it can only break at glue ifthat glue is preceded by a  non-discardable item.\spoint Finite \cs{parfillskip}In plain \TeX, \cs{parfillskip} has a (first-order) infinitestretch component. All other glue in the last line of a paragraph will then be set at natural width.If the \cs{parfillskip} has only finite (or possibly zero)stretch, other glue will be stretched or shrunk.A display formula in a paragraph with such a last linewill be surrounded by \cs{abovedisplayskip} and \cs{belowdisplayskip},even if \cs{abovedisplayshortskip} glue would be in order.The reason for this is that glue setting is slightlymachine-dependent, and any such processes should be keptout of \TeX's global decisions.\spoint A precaution for paragraphs that do not indentIf you are setting a text with both the paragraph indentationand the white space between paragraphs zero, you run the riskthat the start of a new paragraph may be indiscernible whenthe last line of the previous paragraph ends almostor completely flush right.A~sensible precaution for this is to set the \cs{parfillskip}to, for instance \Ver> \parfillskip=1cm plus 1fil<Revinstead of the usual \n{0cm~plus~1fil}.On the other hand, you may let yourself be convinced by\cite[Tsch] that paragraphs should always indent.\subject[par:shape] Paragraph ShapeThis chapter treats the parameters and commands that influence the\term paragraph shape\parshape of a paragraph.\invent\item parindent       Width of the indentation box added in front of a paragraph.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{20pt}.\item hsize       Line width used for typesetting a paragraph.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{6.5in}.\item leftskip       Glue that is placed to the left of all lines of a paragraph.\item rightskip       Glue that is placed to the right of all lines of a paragraph.\item hangindent         If positive, this indicates indentation from the left margin;       if negative, this is the negative of the indentation       from the right margin.\item hangafter         If positive, this denotes the number of lines       before indenting starts;       if negative, the absolute value of this is the number       of indented lines starting with the first line of the paragraph.      Default:~\n1.\item parshape      Command for general paragraph shapes.\inventstop\point The width of text linesWhen \TeX\ has finished absorbing a paragraph, \term line width\parit has formed a horizontal list, starting with an indentationbox, and ending with \cs{parfillskip} glue.This list is then broken into lines of length \cs{hsize}.\csterm hsize\par\csterm leftskip\par\csterm rightskip\parEach line of a paragraph is padded left and right withcertain amounts of glue, the \cs{leftskip} and \cs{rightskip},which are taken into account in reaching \cs{hsize}.The values of \cs{leftskip} and \cs{rightskip} are taken into account in the line-breaking algorithm.Thus the main point about the \cs{raggedright} \csterm raggedright\parmacro in plain \TeX\ and the \LaTeX\ `flushleft'environment is that theyset the \cs{rightskip} to  zero plus some stretch.The commands \cs{parshape} and \cs{hangindent}also affect line width. They work by altering the\cs{hsize} and afterwards shifting the boxes containing the lines.\point Shape parameters\spoint Hanging indentation\message{twolines?}A simple, and frequently occurring, paragraph shape is that\term hanging indentation\par\csterm hangafter\par\csterm hangindent\parwith a number of starting or trailing lines indented.\TeX\ can realize such shapes using two parameters:\cs{hangafter} and \cs{hangindent}.Both can assume positive and negative values.The \cs{hangindent} controls the amount of indentation:\itemlist\item \cs{hangindent}${}>0$: the paragraphis indented at the left margin by this amount.\item\cs{hangindent}${}<0$: the paragraph is indentedat the right margin by the absolute value of this amount.\>\def\exnul{\leftskip=0pt \rightskip=0pt \relax}For example (assume \cs{parindent=0pt}),\disp\leavevmode\message{Check parshape example!}%\hbox{\Distance:verbatimwhiteleft=0pt$\vcenter{\snugbox{\Ver> a a a a a a a a a a a a ... \hangindent=10pt a a a a a a a a a a a a ... \hangindent=-10pt a a a a a a a a a a a a ...<Rev}}$\Spaces:2 gives \Spaces:2$\vcenter{\parindent0pt \setbox0\hbox{a a a a a}\hsize\wd0 \leftskip=0pt %\parskip6pt  a a a a a a a a a a a a \dots\par%\vskip\baselineskip \hangindent=10pt a a a a a a a a a a a a \dots\par%\vskip\baselineskip \hangindent=-10pt a a a a a a a a a a a a \dots\par}$}\>The default value of \cs{hangindent} is~\n{0pt}.The \cs{hangafter} parameter determines the number oflines that is indented:\itemlist\item \cs{hangafter}${}\geq0$: after this number of lines the rest of the lines will beindented; in other words, this many lines from thestart of the paragraph will not be indented.\item \cs{hangafter}${}<0$: the absolute value of thisis the number of lines that will be indented startingat the beginning of the paragraph.\>For example,\disp\leavevmode\hbox{\Distance:verbatimwhiteleft=0pt$\vcenter{\snugbox{\Ver> a a a a a a a a a a a a ... \hangindent=10pt \hangafter=2 a a a a a a a a a a a a ... \hangindent=10pt \hangafter=-2 a a a a a a a a a a a a ...<Rev}}$ \Spaces:2 looks like \Spaces:2$\vcenter{\parindent0pt \setbox0\hbox{a a a a a}\hsize\wd0 \leftskip=0pt %\parskip6pt a a a a a a a a a a a a \dots\par%\vskip\baselineskip \hangindent=10pt \hangafter=2 a a a a a a a a a a a a \dots\par%\vskip\baselineskip \hangindent=10pt \hangafter=-2 a a a a a a a a a a a a \dots\par}$}\>The default value for \cs{hangafter} is~\n1.With both parameters having the possibility tobe positive and negative,four ways of hanging indentation result. See belowfor hanging indentation into the margin (`outdent').Hanging indentation is implemented as follows.The amount of hanging indentation is subtractedfrom the \cs{hsize} for the lines that indent;after the paragraph has been broken into horizontalboxes, the lines that should indent on the left areshifted right.Regular indentation of size \cs{parindent} is notinfluenced by hanging indentation. Thus you shouldstart a paragraph with hanging indentation explicitly by~\cs{noindent} if the extraindentation is unwanted.The default values of \cs{hangindent} and \cs{hangafter} arerestored after every \cs{par} command.\spoint General paragraph shapes: \cs{parshape}Quite general paragraph shapes can be implemented\csterm parshape\parusing \cs{parshape}. With this command line lengths and indentationfor the first $n$ linesof a paragraph can be specified. Thus this commandtakes $2n+1$ parameters: the number of lines $n$, followedby $n$ pairs of an indentation   and a line length.\disp \cs{parshape}\gr{equals}    $n$ $i_1$ $\ell_1$ $\ldots$ $i_n$ $\ell_n$\>The   specification for the last line is repeated if theparagraph following has more than $n$ lines. If there are fewerthan $n$ lines the remaining specifications are ignored.The default value is (naturally) \cs{parshape${}={}$0}.A \cs{parshape} command takes precedence over a \cs{hangindent}if both have been specified. %Regular \cs{parindent} indentation%is suppressed if \cs{parshape} is in effect.Regular \cs{parindent}, \cs{leftskip}, and \cs{rightskip} are still obeyed if \cs{parshape} is in effect.The \cs{parshape} parameter is, like \cs{hangindent}, \cs{hangafter},and \cs{looseness} (see Chapter~\ref[line:break]),cleared after a \cs{par}command. Since every empty line generates a \cs{par} token,one should not leave an empty linebetween a paragraph shape (or hanging indentation)declaration and the following paragraph.The control sequence\alt\cs{parshape} is an \gr{internal integer}:its value is the number of lines $n$ with whichit was set.\point Assorted remarks\spoint Centred last linesEqual stretch and shrink amounts for the \cs{leftskip} and \cs{rightskip}give centred texts, in the sense that each line iscentred. For proper centring of the firstand last lines of a paragraph the \cs{parindent} and\cs{parfillskip} have to be made zero.However, the margins are ragged.A surprising application of \cs{leftskip} and \cs{rightskip}\howto Centre the first/""last line of a paragraph\parleads to paragraphs with flush margins and a centredlast line.\Ver>\leftskip=0cm plus 0.5fil \rightskip=0cm plus -0.5fil\parfillskip=0cm plus 1fil<RevFor all lines of a paragraph but the last one the stretch componentsadd up to zero so the \cs{leftskip} and \cs{rightskip}inserted are zero.On the last line the \cs{parfillskip} adds \hbox{\n{plus 1fil}}of stretch; therefore there is a total of\hbox{\n{plus 0.5fil}} of stretch at both the left and rightend of the line.It would have been incorrect to specify\Ver>\leftskip=0cm plus 0.5fil \rightskip=0cm minus 0.5fil<Rev\TeX\ gives an error about this: it complains about`infinite shrinkage'.Centring not only the last line, but also thefirst line of a paragraph can be done bythe parameter settings\Ver>\parindent=0pt \everypar{\hskip 0pt plus -1fil}\leftskip=0pt plus .5fil\rightskip=0pt plus -.5fil<RevThis time a horizontal skip inserted by \cs{everypar}combines with the \cs{leftskip} to give the sameamount of stretchability on both sides of thefirst line of the paragraph.\spoint Indenting into the marginSuppose you want a hanging indent of \n{1cm} {\sl into\/}\howto Indent into the margin\parthe left margin after the first two lines of a paragraph. Specifying \ver/\hangindent=-1cm/ will givea hanging indentation of one centimetre from the {\sl right\/}margin, so another approach is necessary.

They are, but only to a certain   extent.\alttSetting \cs{leftskip} to some positive value for a paragraphmeans that the \cs{hsize} stays the same, but every linestarts with a glue item. Hanging indentation, on the other hand,is implemented by decreasing the \cs{hsize} value for thelines that hang, and shifting the finished horizontal boxes horizontally in the surrounding vertical list.The difference between the two approaches becomes visiblemainly in the fact that display formulas are not shiftedwhen the \cs{leftskip} is altered.See Chapter~\ref[rules] for an example showing how leadersare affected by margin shifting.\spoint More examplesSome more examples of paragraph shapes (effected byvarious means) can be found in~\cite[E1]. One examplefrom that article appears on page~\pgref[varioset].\subject[line:break]  Line BreakingThis chapter treats line breaking and the concept of `badness' that \TeX\uses to decide how to break a paragraph into lines,or where to break a page.The various penalties contributing to the cost of line breakingare treated here, as is hyphenation.Page breaking is treated in Chapter~\ref[page:break].\invent \item penalty       Specify desirability of not breaking at this point.\item linepenalty       Penalty value associated with each line break.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{10}.\item hyphenpenalty       Penalty associated with break at a discretionary item      in the general case.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{50}.\item exhyphenpenalty       Penalty for breaking a horizontal line at a discretionary      item in the special case where the prebreak text is empty.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{50}.\item adjdemerits       Penalty for adjacent visually incompatible lines.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{10$\,$000}.\item doublehyphendemerits       Penalty for consecutive lines ending with a hyphen.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{10$\,$000}.\item finalhyphendemerits       Penalty added when the penultimate line of a       paragraph ends with a hyphen.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{5000}.\item allowbreak       Macro for creating a breakpoint by inserting a      \cs{penalty0}.\item pretolerance       Tolerance value for a paragraph without hyphenation.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{100}.\item tolerance       Tolerance value for lines in a paragraph with hyphenation.       Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{200}.\item emergencystretch      (\TeX3 only)      Assumed extra stretchability in lines of a paragraph.\item looseness        Number of lines by which this paragraph has to be made longer       than it would be ideally.\item prevgraf        The number of lines in the paragraph last      added to the vertical list.\item discretionary       Specify the way a character sequence is split up at a line break.\item -       Discretionary hyphen; this is      equivalent to \ver|\discretionary{-}{}{}|.\item hyphenchar       Number of the hyphen character of a font.\item defaulthyphenchar       Value of \cs{hyphenchar} when a font is loaded.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{`\cs{-}}.\item uchyph       Positive to allow hyphenation of words starting with a capital       letter.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{1}.\item lefthyphenmin       (\TeX3 only)      Minimal number of characters before a hyphenation.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{2}.\item righthyphenmin       (\TeX3 only)      Minimum number of characters after a hyphenation.      Plain \TeX\ default:~\n{3}.\item patterns       Define a list of hyphenation patterns for the current      value of \cs{language};  allowed only in \IniTeX.\item hyphenation       Define hyphenation exceptions for the current value of \cs{language}.\item language       Choose a set of hyphenation patterns and exceptions.\item setlanguage       Reset the current language.\inventstop\point Paragraph break cost calculationA paragraph is broken such that the amount $d$ of {\em demerits\/}associated with breaking it is minimized. The total amount of demerits for a paragraph is the sumof those for the individual lines, plus possibly some extrapenalties. Considering a paragraph as a whole instead of breaking it on a line-by-line basis can lead to betterline breaking: \TeX\ can choose to take a slightly less beautifulline in the beginning of the paragraph in order to avoidbigger trouble later on.For each line demerits are calculated from the {\em badness\/}~$b$of stretching or shrinking the line to the break, andthe {\em penalty\/}~$p$ associated with the break.The badness is not allowed to exceed a certain prescribedtolerance.In addition to the demerits for breaking individual lines,\TeX\ assigns demerits for the way lines combine; see below.The implementation of \TeX's paragraph"-breaking algorithmis explained in~\cite[K:break].\spoint BadnessFrom the ratio between the stretch or shrink present in a \term badness and line breaking\parline, and the actual stretch or shrink taken,the `badness' of breaking a line at a certain point is calculated.This badness is an importantfactor in the process of line breaking.See page~\pgref[bad:form] for the formula for badness.In this chapterbadness will only be discussed in the context of line breaking. Badness is also computed when a vertical list is stretchedor shrunk (see Chapter~\ref[page:break]). The following terminology is used to describe badness:\description \item tight (3)is any line that has shrunk with a badness~$b\geq13$, that is, by using at least one-half of its amount of shrink(see page~\pgref[bad:form] for the computation).\item decent (2)is any line with a badness~$b\leq12$.\item loose (1)is any line that has stretched with a badness~$b\geq13$, that is, by using at least one-half of its amount of stretch.\item very loose (0)is any line that has stretched with a badness~$b\geq100$, that is, by using its full amount of stretch or more. Recallthat glue can stretch, but not shrink more than itsallowed amount.\>The numbering is used in trace output (Chapter~\ref[trace]), andit is also used in the following definition:if the classifications of two adjacent lines differ by more than~1,the lines are said to be {\em visually incompatible\/}.See below for the \cs{adjdemerits} parameter associated with this.Overfull horizontal and verticalboxes are passed unnoticed if their excess widthor height is less than \cs{hfuzz} or \cs{vfuzz} respectively; they are not reported if the badness is less than\cs{hbadness} or \cs{vbadness} (see Chapter~\ref[boxes]).\spoint Penalties and other break locations Line breaks can occur at the following places in horizontal\csterm penalty\par\term breakpoints in horizontal lists\par\term penalties in horizontal lists\parlists:\enumerate \item At a penalty. The penalty value is the`aesthetic cost' of breaking the line at that place.Negative penalties are considered as bonuses.A~penalty of $10\,000$ or more inhibits, and a penaltyof $-10\,000$ or less forces, a~break.Putting more than one penaltyin a row is equivalent to putting just the one with theminimal value, because that one is the best candidate for line breaking.Penalties in horizontal mode are inserted by the user (or auser macro). The only exception is the \cs{nobreak}inserted before the \cs{parfillskip} glue.\item At a glue, if it is not part of a math formula, andif it is preceded by a non-discardable item (see Chapter~\ref[hvmode]).There is no penalty associated with breaking at glue.The condition about the non-discardable precursor is necessary, because otherwise breaking in between  two pieces of glue wouldbe possible, which would cause ragged edges to the paragraph.\item At a kern, if it is not part of a math formulaand if it is followed by  glue.There is no penalty associated with breaking at a~kern.\item At a math-off, if that is followed by glue.Since math-off(and math-on) act as kerns (see Chapter~\ref[math]),this is very much like the previous case.There is no penalty associated with breaking at a~math-off.\item At a discretionary break. The penaltyis the \cs{hyphenpenalty} or the \cs{exhyphenpenalty}.This is treated below.\enumeratestopAny discardable material following the break \ldash glue, kerns,math-on/""off and penalties \rdash  is discarded. If one considersa line break at glue (kern, math-on{/}off) to occur at thefront end of the glue item, this implies that that pieceof glue disappears in the break.\spoint DemeritsFrom the badness of a line and the penalty, if any, the demeritsof the line are calculated. Let $l$ be the value of\csterm linepenalty\par\cs{linepenalty}, $b$~the badness of the line,$p$~the penalty at the break; then the demerits $d$\term demerits\parare given by\disp$\displaystyle d=\cases{(l+b)^2+p^2&if $0\leq p<10\,000$\cr           (l+b)^2-p^2&if $-10\,000<p<0$\cr           (l+b)^2    &if $p\leq-10\,000$\cr}$\>Both this formula and the one for the badness are described\altin \cite[K:break] as `quite arbitrary',but they have been shown  to lead togood results in practice.The demerits for a paragraph are the sum of the demerits forthe lines, plus \itemlist\item the \cs{adjdemerits} for any two   \csterm adjdemerits\par   adjacent lines that are not visually compatible (see above),\item \cs{doublehyphendemerits} for any two   \csterm doublehyphendemerits\par   consecutive lines ending with a hyphen, and the\item \cs{finalhyphendemerits}   \csterm finalhyphendemerits\par   if the penultimate line of a paragraph   ends with a hyphen.\itemliststopAt the start of a paragraph \TeX\ acts as ifthere was a preceding line which was `decent'.Therefore \cs{adjdemerits} will be added if the firstline is `very loose'. Also, the last lineof a paragraph is ordinarily also `decent'\ldash all spaces are set at natural widthowing to the infinite stretch in the \cs{parfillskip} \rdash so \cs{adjdemerits} are added ifthe preceding line is `very loose'.Note that the penalties at which a line breakis chosen weigh about as heavily as the badness ofthe line, so they can be relatively small.However, the three extra demerit parametershave to be of the order of the square of penalties and badnesses to weigh equally heavily.\spoint The number of lines of a paragraphAfter a paragraph has been completed (or partiallycompleted prior to a display), the variable \cs{prevgraf}\csterm prevgraf\parrecords the number of lines in the paragraph.By assigning to this variable \ldash andbecause this is a \gr{special integer}such an assignment is automatically global \rdash \TeX's decision processes can be influenced.This may be useful in combination with hanging indentationor \cs{parshape} specifications (see Chapter~\ref[par:shape]).Some direct influence of the line"-breaking processon the resulting number of lines exists. One factoris the \cs{linepenalty} which is included in the demerits of each line. By increasing the line penalty \TeX\ can bemade to minimize the number of lines in a paragraph.Deviations from the optimal number of lines, that is, the\csterm looseness\parnumber of lines stemming from the optimal way of breaking aparagraph into lines, can be forced by the user by meansof the \cs{looseness} parameter. This parameter, which isreset every time the shape parameters are cleared (see Chapter~\ref[par:shape]), indicates by how many lines the currentparagraph should be made longer than is optimal. A~negativevalue of \cs{looseness} will attempt to make the paragraph shorterby a number of lines that is the absolute value of the parameter.\TeX\ will still observe the valuesof \cs{pretolerance} and \cs{tolerance} (see below)when lengthening or shortening a paragraph under influenceof \cs{looseness}.Therefore,\TeX\ will only lengthen or shorten a paragraph for as faras is possible without exceeding these parameters.\spoint[between:lines] Between the lines\TeX'sparagraph mechanism packages lines into horizontal boxesthat are appended to the surrounding vertical list.The resulting sequence of vertical items is then a repeating sequence of\itemlist\item a box containing a line of text,\item possibly migrated vertical material (see page~\pgref[migrate]),\item a penalty item reflecting the cost of a page break      at that point, which is normally the \cs{interlinepenalty}      (see Chapter~\ref[page:break]), and\item interline glue, which is calculated automatically      on basis of the \cs{prevdepth} (see Chapter~\ref[baseline]).\itemliststop\point The process of breaking\TeX\ tries to break paragraphs in such a way that \term paragraphs, breaking into lines\parthe badness of each line does not exceed a certain tolerance.If there exists more than one solution to this, the one withthe fewest demerits is taken.By setting \cs{tracingparagraphs} to a positive value,\csterm tracingparagraphs\par\TeX\ can be made to report the calculations of theparagraph mechanism in the log file. Some implementations of \TeX\may have this option disabled to make \TeX\ run faster.\spoint Three passesFirst an attempt is made to split the paragraph into lineswithout hyphenating, that is, without inserting discretionaryhyphens. This attempt succeeds if none of the\csterm pretolerance\parlines has a badness exceeding \cs{pretolerance}.Otherwise, a second pass is made, inserting discretionariesand using \cs{tolerance}.\csterm tolerance\parIf \cs{pretolerance} is negative, the first pass is omitted.\TeX\ can be made to make a third pass if the first andsecond pass fail.\csterm emergencystretch\parIf \cs{emergency\-stretch} is a positive dimension, \TeX\ will assume this much extra stretchability in each line when badness and demerits are calculated.Thus solutions that only slightly exceeded the giventolerances will now become feasible.However, no glue of size \cs{emergencystretch} isactually present, so underfull box messagesmay still occur.\spoint Tolerance valuesHow muchtrouble \TeX\ will have typesetting a piece of textdepends partly on the tolerance value.Therefore it is sensible to have some idea ofwhat badness values mean in visual terms.For lines that are stretched, the badness is100 times the cube of the stretch ratio.A~badness of 800 thus means that the stretch ratiois~2.If the space is,\altas in the ten-point Computer Modern Font,\Ver>3.33pt plus 1.67pt minus 1.11pt<Reva badness of 800 means that spaces have been stretched to\disp \n{3.33pt}${}+2\times{}$\n{1.67pt}${}={}$\n{6.66pt}\>that is, to exactly double their natural size.It is up to you to decide whether this is too large.\point DiscretionariesA discretionary item \ver-\discretionary{..}{..}{..}-\term discretionary item\par\csterm discretionary\parmarks a place where a word can be broken.Each of the three arguments is a \gr{general text}(see Chapter~\ref[gramm]):they are, in sequence,\itemlist \item the {\em pre-break\/} text, which is appendedto the part of the word before the break,\item the {\em post-break\/} text, which is prepended to the partof the word after the break, and\item the {\em no-break\/} text, which is used if the wordis not broken at the discretionary item.\itemliststopFor example: \ver>ab\discretionary{g}{h}{cd}ef>is the word \hbox{\n{abcdef}}, but it can be hyphenated\altwith \n{abg} before the break and \n{hef} after.Note that there is no automatic hyphen character.All three texts may contain any sorts of tokens,but any primitive commands and macrosshould expand to boxes, kerns, and characters.\spoint Hyphens and discretionariesInternally, \TeX\ inserts the equivalent of\csterm hyphenchar\par\term hyphen character\par\Ver>\discretionary{\char\hyphenchar\font}{}{}<Revat every place where a word can be broken. Nosuch discretionary is inserted if \ver>\hyphenchar\font>is not in the range 0--255, or if its position in thefont is not filled.When a font is loaded, its \cs{hyphenchar} value\csterm defaulthyphenchar\paris set to \cs{defaulthyphenchar}. The \cs{hyphenchar}value can be changed after this.In plain \TeX\ the \cs{defaulthyphenchar} has the value~\ver>`\->, sofor all fonts character~45 (the \ascii\ hyphen character)is the hyphen sign, unlessit is specified otherwise.The primitive command \ver|\-| (called a `discretionary hyphen')\csterm -\par\term discretionary hyphen\paris equivalent to the above\ver|\discretionary{\char\hyphenchar\font}{}{}|.Breaking at such a discretionary, whether inserted implicitlyby \TeX\ or explicitly by the user, has\csterm hyphenpenalty\para cost of \cs{hyphenpenalty}.In unrestricted horizontal mode an empty discretionary\cs{disc\-re\-tio\-na\-ry}\ver-{}{}{}-is automatically inserted after characterswhose character code is the \cs{hyphenchar} value of the font, thus enabling hyphenation at that point.The penalty for breaking a line atsuch a discretionary with an empty pre-break text\csterm exhyphenpenalty\paris \cs{exhyphenpenalty}, that is, the `explicit hyphen' penalty.If a word containsdiscretionary breaks, for instance because of  explicit hyphen characters,\TeX\ will not consider it for further hyphenation.People have solved the ensuing problems by trickssuch as\howto Enable hyphenation of a word containing a hyphen\par\Ver>\def\={\penalty10000 \hskip0pt -\penalty0 \hskip0pt\relax}... integro\=differential equations...<RevThe skips before and after the hyphen lead \TeX\ intotreating the first and second half of the compound expression as separate words; the penaltybefore the first skip inhibits breaking before the hyphen.\spoint Examples of discretionariesLanguages such as German or Dutch have words that change\term languages\parspelling when hyphenated (German: `\hbox{backen}'becomes `\hbox{bak-ken}'; Dutch: `\hbox{autootje}'becomes `\hbox{auto-tje}'). This problem can be solvedwith \TeX's discretionaries. For instance, for German (this is inspired by~\cite[Partl]):\Ver>\catcode`\"=\active\def"#1{\ifx#1k\discretionary{k-}{k}{ck}\fi}<Revwhich enables the user to write \ver>ba"ken>.In Dutch there is a further problem which allows a nicesystematic solution. Umlaut characters (`trema' is theDutch term) should oftendisappear in a break, for instance `\hbox{na"apen}'hyphenates as `\hbox{na-apen}', and `\hbox{onbe"invloedbaar}'hyphenates as `\hbox{onbe-invloedbaar}'. A solution(inspired by~\cite[Babel]) is\Ver>\catcode`\"=\active\def"#1{\ifx#1i\discretionary{-}{i}{\"\i}%        \else  \discretionary{-}{#1}{\"#1}\fi}<Revwhich enables the user to type \ver>na"apen> and\ver>onbe"invloedbaar>.\point Hyphenation\TeX's hyphenation algorithm uses a list of patterns to\term hyphenation\pardetermine at what places a word that is a candidate forhyphenation can be broken.Those aspects of hyphenation connected with thesepatterns aretreated in appendix~H of \TeXbook;the method of generating hyphenation patterns automaticallyis described in~\cite[Liang]. People have been knownto generate lists of patterns by hand; see for instance~\cite[Vas:add]. Such hand-generated listsmay be superior to automatically generated lists.Here it will mainly be described how \TeX\ declares a word tobe a candidate for hyphenation. The  problem here ishow to cope with punctuation and things such as quotation marksthat can be attached to a word. Also, {\em implicit kerns\/},that is, kerns inserted because of font information,must  be handled properly.\spoint Start of a word\TeX\ starts at glue items (if they are not in math mode)looking for a {\em starting letter\/} of a word:a character with non-zero \cs{lccode}, or a ligature startingwith such a character (upper/""lowercase codes are explainedon page~\pgref[uc/lc]).Looking for this starting letter,\TeX\ bypasses any implicit kerns, andcharacters with zero \cs{lccode} (this includes,for instance, punctuation and quotation marks), or ligatures starting withsuch a character.If no suitable starting letter turns up, that is, ifsomething is found that is not a character or ligature,\TeX\ skips to the next glue, and starts this algorithm anew.Otherwise a trial word is collected consisting ofall following characters with non-zero \cs{lccode}from the same font as the starting letter, or ligatures consistingcompletely of such characters. Implicit kerns are allowedbetween the characters and ligatures.If the starting letter is from a font for which the valueof \cs{hyphenchar} is invalid, or for which this characterdoes not exist, hyphenation is abandoned for this word.If the starting letter is an uppercase letter (that is,it is not equal to its own \cs{lccode}), \TeX\ will\csterm uchyph\parabandon hyphenation unless \cs{uchyph} is positive.The default value for this parameter is~1  inplain \TeX,implying that capitalized words are subject to hyphenation.\spoint End of a wordFollowing the trial word can be characters (from anotherfont, or with zero \cs{lccode}), ligatures or implicit kerns.After these items, if any, must follow\itemlist\item glue or an explicit kern,\item a penalty,\item a whatsit, or\item a \cs{mark}, \cs{insert}, or \cs{vadjust} item.\itemliststopIn particular, the word will not be hyphenated if it isfollowed by a \itemlist\item box, \item rule, \item mathformula, or \item discretionary item.\itemliststopSince discretionaries are inserted after the \cs{hyphenchar}of the font, occurrence of this character inhibits furtherhyphenation. Also, placement of accents is implemented usingexplicit kerns (see Chapter~\ref[char]), so any \cs{accent}command is considered to be the end of a word, and inhibitshyphenation of the word.\spoint \TeX2 versus \TeX3There is a noticeable difference in the treatment of\term \TeX\ version 3\parhyphenated fragments between \TeX2 and \TeX3. \TeX2 insists that the part before the break should beat least two characters, and the part after the break threecharacters, long.Typographically this is a sound decision: this waythere are no two-character pieces of a word stranded at theend or beginning of the line. Both before and after the breakthere are at least three characters.In \TeX3 two integer parameters have been introduced to controlthe length of these fragments:\csterm lefthyphenmin\par\csterm righthyphenmin\par\cs{lefthyphenmin} and \cs{righthyphenmin}. These areset to 2 and~3 respectively in the plain format for \TeX3.If the sum of these two is 63 or more, all hyphenation issuppressed.Another addition in \TeX3,the possibility to have several sets of hyphenation patterns,is treated below.\spoint Patterns and exceptionsThe statements \disp\cs{patterns}\gr{general text}\nl\cs{hyphenation}\gr{general text}\dispstopare \gr{hyphenation assignment}s, which are\csterm hyphenation\par\csterm patterns\par\gr{global assignment}s.The \cs{patterns} command, which specifies a listof hyphenation patterns, is allowed only in \IniTeX\(see Chapter~\ref[TeXcomm]),and all patterns must be specified before the firstparagraph is typeset.Hyphenation exceptions can be specified at any time\howto Specify exceptional hyphenations\parwith statements such as\Ver>\hyphenation{oxy-mo-ron gar-goyle}<Revwhich specify locations where a word may be hyphenated.Subsequent \cs{hyphenation} statements are cumulative.In \TeX3 these statements are taken to hold for thelanguage that is the current value of the \cs{language}parameter.\point Switching hyphenation patternsWhen typesetting paragraphs, \TeX\ (version~3) can use several\alt\term languages\parsets of patterns and hyphenation exceptions, for at most 256languages. If a \cs{patterns} or \cs{hyphenation}command is given (see above), \TeX\ stores the patterns or exceptions\csterm language\parunder the current value of the \cs{language} parameter.The \cs{patterns} command is only allowed in \IniTeX, andpatterns must be specified before any typesetting is done.Hyphenation exceptions, however, canbe specified cumulatively, and not only in \IniTeX.In addition to the \cs{language} parameter, \term current language\parwhich can be set by the user, \TeX\ has internally a `currentlanguage'. This is set to zero at the start of every paragraph.For every character that is added to a paragraphthe current language is compared with the value of \cs{language},and if they differ  a whatsit element is added to the horizontallist, resetting the current language to the value of \cs{language}.At the start of a paragraph, this whatsit is inserted\alttafter the \cs{everypar} tokens, but \cs{lastbox}can still access the indentation box.As an example, suppose that a format has been created such thatlanguage~0 is English, and language~1 is Dutch. English hyphenationswill then be used if the user does not specify otherwise;if a job starts with \Ver>\language=1<Rev the whole documentwill be set using Dutch hyphenations, because \TeX\ will inserta command changing the current language at the start ofevery paragraph. For example:\Ver>\language=1T...<Rev gives\Ver>.\hbox(0.0+0.0)x20.0           % indentation.\setlanguage1 (hyphenmin 2,3) % language whatsit.\tenrm T                      % start of text<RevThe whatsit can be inserted explicitly, without changing\csterm setlanguage\parthe value of \cs{language}, by specifying\disp\cs{setlanguage}\gr{number}\dispstopHowever, this will hardly ever be needed.One case where it may be necessary is when the contents ofa horizontal box are unboxed to a paragraph: inside the box nowhatsits are added automatically, since inside such a boxno hyphenation can take place.See page~\pgref[wide:vbox] for another problem with textin horizontal boxes.\endinput
