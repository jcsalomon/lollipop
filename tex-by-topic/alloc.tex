\subject[alloc] Allocation\TeX\ has registers of a number of types. For some of these,explicit commands exist to define a synonym for a certain register;for all of them macros exist in the plain formatto allocate an unused register. This chapter treatsthe synonym and allocation commands, and discussessome guidelines for macro writers regarding allocation.\invent\item countdef       Define a synonym for a \cs{count} register.\item dimendef      Define a synonym for a \cs{dimen} register.\item muskipdef      Define a synonym for a \cs{muskip} register.\item skipdef       Define a synonym for a \cs{skip} register.\item toksdef       Define a synonym for a \cs{toks} register.\item newbox      Allocate an unused \cs{box} register.\item newcount      Allocate an unused \cs{count} register.\item newdimen      Allocate an unused \cs{dimen} register.\item newfam      Allocate an unused math family.\item newinsert      Allocate an unused insertion class.\item newlanguage      (\TeX3 only)      Allocate a new language number.\item newmuskip      Allocate an unused \cs{muskip} register.\item newskip      Allocate an unused \cs{skip} register.\item newtoks      Allocate an unused \cs{toks} register.\item newread      Allocate an unused input stream.\item newwrite      Allocate an unused output stream.\>\point Allocation commandsIn plain \TeX, \cs{new...} macros are defined forallocation of registers.The registers of \TeX\ fall into two classes that are \term registers, allocation of\parallocated in different ways. This is treated below.The \cs{newlanguage} macro of plain \TeX\ \csterm newlanguage\pardoes not allocate any register. Instead it merely assignsa number, starting from~0.\TeX\ (version~3) can have at most 256 differentsets of hyphenation patterns.The \cs{new...} macros of plain \TeX\ are defined to be\cs{outer} (see Chapter~\ref[macro] for a precise explanation),which precludes use of the allocation macros in other macros.Therefore the \LaTeX\ format redefines these macroswithout the \cs{outer} prefix.\spoint \cs{count}, \cs{dimen}, \cs{skip}, \cs{muskip}, \cs{toks}For these registers there exists a \gr{registerdef} command,for instance \cs{countdef}, to couple a specific registerto a control sequence:\Disp\gr{registerdef}\gr{control     sequence}\gr{equals}\gr{8-bit number}\DispstopAfter the definition \Ver>\countdef\MyCount=42<Revthe allocated register can be used as\Ver>\MyCount=314<Rev or \Ver>\vskip\MyCount\baselineskip<RevThe \gr{registerdef} commands are used in plain \TeX\ macros\cs{newcount} et cetera that allocate an unused register;after\Ver>\newcount\MyCount<Rev \cs{MyCount} can be usedexactly as in the above two examples.\spoint \cs{box}, \cs{fam}, \cs{write}, \cs{read}, \cs{insert}For these registers there exists no  \gr{registerdef} command in \TeX,so \cs{chardef} is used to allocate box registersin the corresponding plain \TeX\ macros \cs{newbox}, for instance.The fact that \cs{chardef} is used implies that thedefined control sequence does not stand for the register itself,but only for its number. Thus after \Ver>\newbox\MyBox<Revit is necessary to write \Ver>\box\MyBox<Rev Leaving out the \cs{box} means that the characterin the current font with number\cs{MyBox} is typeset. The \cs{chardef} commandis treated further in Chapter~\ref[char].\point Ground rules for macro writersThe \cs{new...} macros of plain \TeX\ have been designedto form a foundation for macro packages, such thatseveral of such packages can operate without collisionsin the same run of \TeX. In appendix~B of \TeXbook\Knuth formulates some ground rules that macro writers shouldadhere to.\enumerate\item The \cs{new...} macros do not allocate registerswith numbers~0--9. These can therefore be used as `scratch'registers. However, as any macro family can use them,no assumption can be made about the permanency of theircontents. Results that are to be passed from one call toanother should reside in specifically allocated registers.Note that count registers 0--9 are used for page identificationin the \n{dvi} file (see Chapter~\ref[TeXcomm]), so no global assignmentsto these should be made.\item \cs{count255}, \cs{dimen255}, and \cs{skip255} arealso available. This is because inserts areallocated from 254 downward  and, together with an insertion box,a count, dimen, and skip register, all with the same number, are allocated.Since \cs{box255} is used by the output routine (see Chapter~\ref[output]),the count, dimen, and skip with number~255 are freely available.\item Assignments to scratch registers~0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and~255should be local; assignments to registers~1, 3, 5, 7,~9should be \cs{global} (with the exception of the \cs{count}registers). This guideline prevents `savestack build-up' (see Chapter~\ref[error]).\item Any register can be used inside a group, as \TeX'sgrouping mechanism will restore its value outsidethe group. There are two conditions on this use ofa register:no global assignments should be made to it, and it must not be possible that other macros may beactivated in that group that perform global assignmentsto that register.\item Registers that are used over longer periods of time,or that have to survive in between calls of differentmacros, should be allocated by \cs{new...}.\enumeratestop\endinput
