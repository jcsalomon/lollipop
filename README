About Lollipop and its manual.

You have obtained a package containing the Lollipop format 
and its manual.


The manual uses only Computer Modern, but there are a few
lines in `manual.tex' that allow you to switch easily to Times
and Helvetica on Macintosh and Unix systems.

The manual is a pretty good illustration of the power of
Lollipop, but there is also a file 'address.tex' which
contains example macros for an address book.

Lollipop is still under development. The manual contains
some remarks about what is still to be done. If you have any
questions, remarks, suggestions (or if you want to voice
your appreciation :-) , feel free to contact me:

Here is how much of TeX's memory the manual used:
 1367 strings out of 4672
 16421 string characters out of 20445
 69825 words of memory out of 70656
 3289 multiletter control sequences out of 10000
 19 hyphenation exceptions out of 307
 28i,4n,24p,185b,556s stack positions out of 
  200i,60n,60p,5000b,2000s
Output written on manual (60 pages, 147943 bytes).

This clearly doesn't fit in the old-fashioned 64K TeX. If
you don't have a BigTeX, follow the directions in the
manual.tex file to process the manual in two parts. You will
have to comment out once the first and once the second half,
only formatting the other half. Since all auxiliary files
have been supplied, this works. (Even then both halves of
the manual barely fit in a 64k memory.) Otherwise formatting
proceeds as indicated above.
